The present situation in Gaza calls for collective healing of intergenerational trauma through mindfulness practice in community.\n\nThe talk concludes with a new English translation of a poem by Thay, \"Festival of a Thousand Stars,\" which reflects on compassion and breaking free from the confines of rigid laws.
