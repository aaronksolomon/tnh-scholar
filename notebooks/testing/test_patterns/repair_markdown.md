# Task

Repair the markdown text given using the following strategy:

- Standardize heading levels to improve consistency. For example, use `#` for chapter titles, `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections, and further nest as needed.
- Remove page number references and redundant headings as in "#### CHAPTER 1. INDIVIDUALS IN GROUPS 7"
- Use consistent heading levels for repeated elements within chapters like "Chapter Summary" or "Key Concepts."
- Eliminate unnecessary numbers and symbols that break the flow, such as random numbers like "3", "4", or misplaced symbols like "! scope".
- Ensure that story titles, such as _Corporate Jenny_ and _Oblivious Andrew_, are italicized consistently throughout.
- Fix misnumbering or misplaced chapter numbers, like ensuring that chapter titles do not appear in random places as they do under the section titles.
- Convert inline quotes attributed to individuals by prefixing them with a `>` for better formatting.
- Break long paragraphs into multiple paragraphs based on their thematic content to enhance readability.
- Remove stray text or phrases like "< Diagram of hierarchy >" that do not belong within the body of text or restructure them into clear diagrams.
- Enhance lists within chapters by using bullet points for lists of examples or steps to make them clear and readable.
- Correct the arrangement within lists and paragraphs where continuity is disrupted by disordered content.
- Ensure consistent spacing between sections, paragraphs, and bullet points for visual clarity.
- Align all content consistently with markdown syntax to maintain clean document structure and hierarchy, including tables or diagrams, if any are present.
- Use horizontal lines `---` to denote visual breaks between major sections or chapters where content transition happens.
- Use blockquotes where specific quotes or content need highlighting.

# Output 
- Output final markdown text only.
