       " '<section>\\n   <title>The Direction of Culture</title>\\n   <p>From ancient times, humanity has been engaged in a struggle. Due to a karmic affinity from time immemorial, humans possess a physical body existing in a universe, amidst a human society, alongside countless other sentient beings. Having life means preserving life, whether through consciousness or instinct.</p>\\n   <p>Heat, cold, wind, rain, hunger, cold, wild beasts, disasters... all these are challenges humans need to overcome to survive. Nature is an enemy, but also a friend. When we are weak, nature threatens; when we are clever, nature serves. With two hands and a mind, humans have exploited nature, utilized nature, and compelled nature to provide the necessities of life.</p>\\n   <p>From the economic lifestyle of gathering to the economic lifestyle of herding and cultivation, humanity has truly advanced. But from the beginning, the object of struggle was not only nature and wild beasts. Humans have consumed each other like beasts devouring humans; thus, from ancient times, people have sought ways to cope with their fellow beings.</p>\\n   <p>Five or seven individuals banded together, using the strength of unity to protect one another. Tribes were formed, and thus, the struggle against nature became more effective. The tribal system marked a step forward for humanity on the path of survival. These human groups developed laws, customs, rituals, entertainment, and unique survival methods. They had culture.</p>\\n   <p>From the tribal organization, humanity gradually moved toward the organization of nations. During this period, intellect expanded, and the consciousness of kinship swiftly developed. The phenomenon of humans eating humans did not frequently occur anymore: now, humans directed all their mental and physical energies towards exploiting nature.</p>\\n   <p>Yet the more nature was exploited, the more resources and food it provided. Simultaneously, technological advancements occurred: the scope of exploitation and production expanded at an unimaginable pace. Economic issues suddenly became critical. Conflicts erupted between nations and between social classes. War broke out fiercely. Science and technology turned to serve war, producing bombs, bullets, and weaponry. While struggling against nature, humans turned their weapons against each other.</p>\\n   <p>People died, blood spilled, flesh torn. In the past, with limited means of production and crude tools, humanity did not die in such numbers as now. All human greed and anger have been awakened; people have used many malicious schemes to confront one another. Killing fellow humans? Never mind. As long as it serves the class, satisfies personal desires. People kill under the guise of ideals: killing to eliminate disease, to build peace. To counteract killings, naturally, the opposing side must also resort to killing...</p>\\n   <p>In the past, a black savage eating a white person was called barbaric. Today, a nation with bombs that can kill more people than any other is called civilized. In truth, this is nothing more than a horrific barbarity.</p>\\n   <p>Previously, the direction of culture was a struggle against nature. Now, the direction of culture is a struggle against fellow humans.</p>\\n   <notes>\\n       This text reflects on the evolution of human culture from ancient times, highlighting the transition from battling nature to battling each other. It emphasizes the dual nature of human progress, where advancements in technology and organization have led both to greater control over the environment and to devastating conflicts among humans. The reflection is particularly poignant in the context of post-colonial Vietnam and the global tensions of the 20th century.\\n   </notes>\\n   <translation-notes>\\n       <p>The term \"nghiệp cảm\" was translated as \"karmic affinity\" to convey the Buddhist concept of karma influencing human existence. \"Vũ trụ\" was rendered as \"universe\" to encapsulate the sense of a vast, encompassing space. \"Sát hại\" was translated to \"killing\" to preserve the gravity of violence discussed in the text, and \"dã man mọi rợ\" was expressed as \"horrific barbarity\" to emphasize the severe critique on modern warfare.</p>\\n   </translation-notes>\\n</section>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>Affirming the Value of Human Beings</title>\\n    <p>In a field of fierce and vast struggle, using harm to prevent harm is an illusion that cannot be achieved. The law of cause and effect never errs: sow the wind and reap the storm, plant corn and harvest corn, plant beans and receive beans, and if one sows harm, they will endure the consequences of harm.</p>\\n    <p>Humans must be conscious of this crucial point and must acknowledge that culture has lost its way.</p>\\n    <p>People need to see that desires of greed and anger have caused chaos in the world and must return to themselves to initiate a great purification within their inner realm. They must be aware that they contain elements of wisdom and compassion, but also elements of delusion and desire.</p>\\n    <p>Delusional desires have obscured compassion and wisdom: humans must strive to eliminate them, to nurture wisdom and compassion. With wisdom and compassion, humans can attain happiness and can unite deeply to create a beautiful shared life.</p>\\n    <p>In the past, culture shifted from struggling with nature to struggling with fellow humans. The direction of the new culture of humanity must be a struggle with personal desires.</p>\\n    <author>P. G., V. N.</author>\\n    <p>The issue of the value of human beings is a crucial issue for existence. As long as this issue is not resolved, people cannot find peace of mind to establish their destiny. Solving this problem allows humans to have a firm standpoint and a decisive attitude towards their own liberation.</p>\\n    <p>What is the value of human beings and what can they do with all their inherent abilities? The element that determines all aspects of life lies within humans or somewhere else? These are fundamental questions. People can achieve peace and happiness, everyone believes so and wants to believe so. But how to achieve it? What means to use, and where to place trust?</p>\\n    <p>Since ancient times, humanity has lived under the threats of nature. Frightened by phenomena like water, fire, and lightning, humans have long submitted to supernatural forces they believe lurk everywhere. Offering prayers to wish for blessings and avoid disasters represents complete submission: humans placed themselves under the protection of ghosts and deities, feeling that all their successes and failures are decided by these divine beings. If the deities are pleased, then success ensues; if angered, then ruin follows. Thus, the thought of bribery emerged, and people thought that just some offerings could win the favor of the deities.</p>\\n    <p>Once everything in life is acknowledged as decided by deities, humans must always live in fear, not daring to make any decisions on their own. Therefore, divination arises, seeking the guidance of divine beings. Here, the value of humans is truly minimal.</p>\\n    <p>As intellect developed, humanity, through philosophical reasoning, arrived at a more refined concept of belief. Polytheism gradually gave way to monotheism, and instead of believing in mixed forces, people turned to believe in a single omnipotent, omniscient divine being who arranges all matters in life. Those who receive the favor of this divine being will have happiness and be liberated from suffering. Here, humans no longer engage in the ridiculous bribery of the past and have learned about the necessary virtues. However, their minds are still placed in a distant world, and when they seek the divine, they fully believe that only the divine they pray to can bestow blessings and save them from suffering. The value of humans here is not much higher. If everything is arranged by the divine, then humans, with a mind and two hands, hold no significant position in life.</p>\\n    <p>The day science emerged, humanity shifted its trust somewhat. People no longer looked up to the heavens with hope but placed their trust in the fairy of science, which was unveiling marvelous wonders. Many were ready to deny all else, only to hope and trust in science. But as science advanced, so did technology; once Western societies mechanized, Eastern societies followed. The issues of production and consumption gave rise to overall competition. Humans became somewhat mechanical when living in a mechanized society; economic competition sparked wars. Wars demand weapons, and science was immediately driven to produce killing tools. The birth of the atomic bomb is a terrifying threat.</p>\\n    <p>The latest scientific inventions today are being applied to the act of killing. Science has become a perilous double-edged sword. It is a monster nurtured by humans, now threatening them. Just one small mistake, and humans could be annihilated by it.</p>\\n    <p>Abandoning science is madness because science can serve humanity effectively. But placing faith in it as one would in divine power is a grave mistake. Science is only a product of a mind guided by dark desires. Excessive faith in it means humans have forgotten themselves, that is, have denied all the beautiful values they inherently possess.</p>\\n    <p>Alongside those who blindly trust in science, there are those who blindly trust in principles and organizations. In today\\'s society, people have beautiful principles to broadly ensure rights and freedom. Humans boast of having complete, rational organizations. However, no matter how many beautiful principles and organizations exist, humans still do not see any progress on the path to happiness. People rely on having beautiful principles and organizations and think that applying them will lead to success. No! Reality has proven that principles and organizations alone are not sufficient. To implement them, there must be humans worthy of being called humans. A constitution alone cannot guarantee the future of a nation! To ensure the implementation of that constitution, there must be worthy parliaments with talent and virtue. Here, humans are forgotten, and the true value of humans has been diminished.</p>\\n    <p>Trusting in principles or organizations is not much different from trusting in lifeless material. Moreover, people are sometimes easily deceived by words and language. After the great wars, charters and declarations spread everywhere. Freedom, equality, liberation, happiness, independence... so many beautiful words like the dawn on the horizon were put forth. Every great nation in the world wants to be a leader, a benefactor, a savior of humanity. But in the end, those \"nominal but unreal\" farces gradually sow doubt among the masses, and, in the words of a certain writer, all the leaflets and banners released with beautiful words ultimately fail to mend the deep wounds that history has called bewilderment.</p>\\n    <p>All the suffering of humanity, in fact, stems from misplaced beliefs. From belief in deities to belief in science, principles, organizations, and beautiful words, humans have indeed somewhat denied their value. Humans have forgotten themselves to seek happiness in forces outside of themselves.</p>\\n    <p>All the successes and failures of humans must be created by humans themselves. Humans determine their fate.</p>\\n    <notes>\\n        The section reflects the philosophical and spiritual exploration of human value, emphasizing self-awareness and inner transformation. It critiques reliance on external forces—whether supernatural, scientific, or societal—for happiness, urging a return to innate wisdom and compassion for true fulfillment. This perspective is deeply rooted in Buddhist teachings, advocating for mindfulness and an understanding of cause and effect in shaping one’s destiny.\\n    </notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        The original text in Vietnamese contains several poetic and philosophical terms that have been translated to convey similar depth and meaning in English. Notably: \\n        - \"gieo gió gặt bão\" is translated as \"sow the wind and reap the storm,\" maintaining the metaphorical relation to consequences.\\n        - \"si mê dục vọng\" is rendered as \"delusional desires,\" encapsulating the idea of desires clouding judgment.\\n        - \"tư tưởng - hối lộ\" is translated as \"thought of bribery,\" referring to the belief in influencing divine favor with offerings.\\n        - The term \"quái vật\" translates to \"monster,\" symbolizing the dangerous potential of science when misused.\\n    </translation-notes>\\n</section>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>What Factors Determined the Success of Nguyễn Công Trứ?</title>\\n    <p>The individual is fully responsible for self-liberation. Whether society is good or life is happy depends on the individual.</p>\\n    <p>Indeed, human beings possess the highest value. Yet for a long time, people have neglected this. People are not nurtured, cultivated, or trained. While humans become increasingly corrupt, they still believe that skilled hands can build happiness with those tools.</p>\\n    <p>The status and value of humans have indeed become clear. If we do not rely on values outside of humanity, we must recognize this value and act accordingly. Conscious of their value and role, individuals must strive to self-train, transform themselves, and find happiness through their own actions. Whenever relying on external forces fails, humans have believed that the crucial issue is to hone tools. But now, the tools are sharp, and people fear their own creations, claiming that tools have become too sophisticated. Thus, it is time to cultivate virtues, so that when individuals become good, society and the universe will also become good. The outward and true aspects of karma are two dimensions of karmic result; recognizing human value is essential to trusting in the professional ability of everyone to create.</p>\\n    <p>Training individuals is the most urgent task of our era.</p>\\n    <author>Dã-Thảo</author>\\n    \\n    <title>What Factors Determined the Success of Nguyễn Công Trứ?</title>\\n    <author>By Minh Hạnh</author>\\n    \\n    <p>Born into a bureaucratic family, Nguyễn Công Trứ had to endure days of poverty and darkness. His father, Đức Ngạn Hầu, led the Cần Vương uprising against the Tây Sơn. After King Lê Chiêu Thống fled to China, the movement disbanded, and Đức Ngạn Hầu returned to his hometown in disillusionment, living a mundane life as a village scholar. Consequently, Nguyễn Công Trứ, following his father, experienced poverty throughout his youth.</p>\\n    \\n    <p>However, this impoverished circumstance did not discourage Nguyễn Công Trứ. He strove to rise above it, to create a remarkable career. In the struggle with reality, this Confucian scholar endured many hardships, but ultimately, he overcame his circumstances and succeeded brilliantly.</p>\\n    \\n    <p>Many other scholars, like Cao Bá Quát, Trần Tế Xương, and others, tasted bitter failures in their careers. But Nguyễn Công Trứ succeeded. We must ask what factor determined this success?</p>\\n    \\n    <p>Poverty brought Nguyễn many hardships. The image of this poverty is vividly depicted in his poem \"Hàn Nho Phong Vị Phú\":</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Look at those four walls of woven leaves, three rooms of grass.</p>\\n        <p>On the beams, one carved star; in front, spiders weave wind curtains,</p>\\n        <p>Short bamboo fence, half kitchen, half room,</p>\\n        <p>Half storing millet and tools.</p>\\n        <p>The bamboo bed, winding all around,</p>\\n        <p>In the clay-walled corner, small holes abound.</p>\\n        <p>Sunlight reflects chicken eggs on the wall, the boy hesitates,</p>\\n        <p>Raindrops pierce mouse holes in the house, the cat peers around.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>This truly is a scene of desolation! The circumstances of a knowledgeable scholar are indeed moving, yet the situation of \"destitution and adversity\" of Nguyễn Công Trứ makes us deeply understand his bitter toil:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>At meals, there\\'s not yet a meal prepared, the child cries like a bee.</p>\\n        <p>Deadline after deadline, creditors call like bellows.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>Due to poverty, Nguyễn Công Trứ had to devise various strategies and sometimes even considered becoming a geomancer or doctor to make ends meet. But as a scholar harboring dreams of social status and fame, proud of his exceptional character and morality, he ultimately did not resort to those desperate means, and returned to daily deprivation:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Medicines are gathered to make do for meals, but thinking of being a worthy physician,</p>\\n        <p>Feigning to deceive and earn a living, yet thinking, how can one uphold the name of a true healer?</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>However, Nguyễn Công Trứ\\'s poverty was not like any other poverty. Because psychologically, Nguyễn Công Trứ was acutely aware of his poverty. More than anyone, he knew he was a \"gentleman,\" a \"hero\":</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Gentlemen in ancient times felt ashamed of poverty.</p>\\n        <p>Heroes, when urgent, also folded their arms,</p>\\n        <p>Leave with nothing, how could one return with nothing?</p>\\n        <p>The debt of scholarship must be paid in full!</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>Yet after many exams, the scholarly debt remained unpaid! Nonetheless, Nguyễn Công Trứ was not discouraged. He consoled himself that fame did not need to be rushed; if one has a body, one must have a name, and if the body exists, fame will eventually follow. Occasionally, he felt melancholic over delayed recognition, but this did not dampen his spirit.</p>\\n    \\n    <p>Cao Bá Quát and Trần Tế Xương later found themselves in similar situations, but lacking firm awareness of timing, they failed to maintain their resolve. Cao, after many exam failures, became pessimistic and disheartened. These continuous failures darkened Cao Bá Quát\\'s soul, and being a person full of emotions, he allowed sorrow to dominate his spirit. The hardships made him suffer, discontent arose, and finally, his obstinate and angry temperament led to failure. Trần Tế Xương also struggled with exams and craved fame as much as anyone. He lived through poverty like Nguyễn, but being quick-tempered and easily discouraged, he angrily mocked others. Mr. Tú Vị-Xuyên truly lacked the demeanor of a true scholar. Observe his petty annoyance when envying those who passed the exams:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>A group of failures stood watching,</p>\\n        <p>It passed this exam, isn\\'t it happy?</p>\\n        <p>On the chair, the madam rises like a duck,</p>\\n        <p>Below the stage, the graduate stretches like a dragon,</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>Yet, he did not stop there! He mocked those who passed the exams, satirized the examiners. All because he failed! If he had passed, perhaps he would not have mocked them like that! Nguyễn Công Trứ was quite different. Despite poverty, hardship, and many failures, he maintained the necessary demeanor of a true scholar. Admittedly, social customs were not beautiful; wealth was valued, and righteousness was scorned, yet he carefully upheld his character:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Everyone competes for their share of cunning,</p>\\n        <p>But I keep my integrity.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>And because of this, often the gentleman and the hero must feign ignorance, play deaf and dumb to endure the hardship. How pitiable for the scholar:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>It is not foolishness, it is not dullness,</p>\\n        <p>But poverty has made one spiritless.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>It was only poverty! But the suffering did not end there: added to the misery of poverty was the suffering of human relations. Nguyễn Công Trứ lamented that in life, only money mattered. All flaws and failures stemmed from a lack of money. With money, one could buy the affection of the world:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>The mouth speaks, already buying resentment,</p>\\n        <p>Empty hands find it hard to compel affection,</p>\\n        <p>Cleverness is nothing compared to the wealthy,</p>\\n        <p>Love comes not to the homeless.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>Truly bitter and disappointing. Pride was sometimes heavily wounded, and character often had to be lowered: those were moments when Nguyễn Công Trứ had to humble himself to please the coarse rich, always knowing only money:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Sometimes sitting in fatigue, stroking one\\'s own beard to act,</p>\\n        <p>Gradually with this and that, it tires one\\'s legs.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>So often Nguyễn Công Trứ got frustrated and bitterly cursed his poverty:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Damn poverty, damn poverty.</p>\\n        <p>No matter how clever, it is all its fault.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>However, this frustration did not drive Nguyễn Công Trứ to recklessness. Poverty did not weaken his will; on the contrary, it forged his resolve to become more enduring. In his heart, Nguyễn Công Trứ always longed to rise and achieve a remarkable career. What that career was, even he was not clearly aware of at first. Nguyễn Công Trứ initially only wished to pass the exams. Passing would mean escaping poverty and having the means to benefit the country and the people. How to benefit the country and the people would be figured out later; for now, passing was enough.</p>\\n    \\n    <p>Thus, the career that Nguyễn Công Trứ dreamed of achieving was primarily fame. He devoted all his attention to the exams. Amid poverty, he patiently hoped for the day his name would adorn the golden list:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>To achieve the fame of a hero, where the world would know,</p>\\n        <p>The path to success was open wide,</p>\\n        <p>The debt of ambition, like a blank page and hands to rejoice...</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>After many failures, people often trust in fate. Nguyễn Công Trứ also believed in fate, but here fate was not a harsh destiny. Being a hero means that fate is not to remain in poverty forever. A gentleman is born to assist the country and its people; if not yet prominent, it\\'s because the time has not come, and any hero must endure poverty first:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>Only true heroes experience poverty.</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>In addition to this belief, there was faith in the cycle of things. Life does not always remain the same; everything changes, moving from hardship to prosperity, from flourishing to decline. Nguyễn Công Trứ did not believe he would remain in this state of hardship forever. Believing in the cycle, he never fell into pessimism because hope remained alive in his heart:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>After hardship comes prosperity.</p>\\n        <p>Winter ends, spring arrives,</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>Thus, Nguyễn Công Trứ patiently awaited:</p>\\n    <i>\\n        <p>As long as there is heaven and earth, mountains and rivers,</p>\\n        <p>Perhaps I won\\'t always be like this?</p>\\n    </i>\\n    \\n    <p>The \"time\" Nguyễn Công Trứ considered was not some sacred, metaphysical factor, but the time that determines success. Why hadn\\'t he passed? Because the time had not come. So, what is \"time\"? Certainly, he did not consider it the period when heaven and earth had yet to allow him to pass. No! \"Time\" was merely the shadow of change. If not this exam, then the next, or the one after that. Exams have failures and successes, that is natural. Nguyễn Công Trứ believed as we Buddhists believe in karma. Everything stems from humans; humans create and receive, with no divine intervention in human affairs.</p>\\n    \\n    <p>Believing this, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived a life of purity and simplicity. He did not become reckless like Cao Bá Quát, nor did he become irritable and lose his scholarly demeanor like Trần Tế Xương. Nguyễn Công Trứ remained calm, content to follow the way, waiting for misfortune to turn to fortune. He knew well that \"full stomach becomes Buddha, empty stomach becomes ghost,\" but he was determined not to...</p>\\n    \\n    <notes>\\n        <p>Nguyễn Công Trứ was a notable Vietnamese scholar, poet, and official in the 19th century, known for his resilience and integrity despite numerous hardships.</p>\\n        <p>Cần Vương was a movement to resist French colonial rule and restore Nguyễn Dynasty sovereignty in Vietnam, led by various Vietnamese scholars and officials.</p>\\n        <p>Cao Bá Quát and Trần Tế Xương were also famous Vietnamese poets, known for their wit and critique of society.</p>\\n    </notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        <p>The original Vietnamese text contains poetic excerpts from Nguyễn Công Trứ\\'s works, reflecting both societal critique and personal resilience.

In discussions with brothers about worldly affairs, he would quote \"to be human is not to be wealthy\". Yet Nguyễn Công Trứ truly succeeded: At the age of 42, he passed the regional examination, was appointed to various positions including Historical Records Officer, and was eventually promoted to Minister of War. His modern fame allowed him to help the country and its people, quelling uprisings and helping reclaim tens of thousands of acres of arable land, establishing prosperous areas such as Kim Sơn and Tiền Hải.</p>\\n    <p>All these grand achievements were possible due to his intense faith in himself. Nguyễn Du embraced lonely loyalty, entrusting everything to the heavens, surrendering his fate. Cao Bá Quát placed too much trust in strategy, unable to endure trials of integrity, disregarding virtue. Trần Tế Xương, after many failures, blamed society and people, asserting that his failure was due to a corrupt society, not realizing he himself lacked the conditions for success. Only Nguyễn Công Trứ held firm belief in the law of cause and effect, and in his own strength. This faith was the most crucial element in his success. This is what Nguyễn Du, Cao Bá Quát, and Trần Tế Xương lacked. Success or failure here was not due to divine or social factors, but a psychological one. Believing in one\\'s abilities and in karma\\'s law, Nguyễn Công Trứ achieved success. Thanks to this belief, he avoided falling into pessimism, maintained his demeanor, and preserved his character. Beautiful causes lead to beautiful effects; a noble life of virtue and continuous effort naturally led Nguyễn Công Trứ to the highest levels of success.</p>\\n    <author>M.H.</author>\\n\\n    <title>Definition and Introduction of Buddhist Literature</title>\\n    <p>Buddhism is a religion founded over twenty centuries ago. The foundation of its doctrine is not just one or two scriptures but a vast treasure trove of rich texts. This abundance has only increased over time. The earliest works required extensive research.</p>\\n    <p>Buddhist literature is the study of the entire corpus of Buddhist texts across eras and sects. Here, we do not claim the grand endeavor that is beyond the capacity of a few individuals. We only present, according to our shallow understanding, the general features of Vietnamese Buddhist literature. If our work helps readers gain a general understanding of Buddhist literature, we are satisfied. First, we present the content of Buddhist literature, then its history and teachings, introducing significant works, and providing an overview of its doctrinal systems. Finally, we dedicate a chapter to Vietnamese Buddhist works across various dynasties.</p>\\n\\n    <subsection>\\n        <title>The Great Canon: The Foundation of Buddhist Literature</title>\\n        <p>The foundational scriptures for studying Buddhism are all contained in the Great Canon. All other Buddhist works stem from these basic scriptures. Beginners in Buddhism must first have a clear concept of the Great Canon to understand the origins of Buddhist culture.</p>\\n        <p>The Great Canon is a general term for all Buddhist scriptures, also known as the Complete Canon or the Three Baskets. In Sanskrit, it is Pitaka, meaning a repository or container. Pitaka implies a basket holding fruits, symbolizing containment and inclusion. La Fuente, in \"Le Dhamma du Bouddha\", translates it as \"basket\". All the teachings of the Buddha throughout his life are contained within it, hence called the Canon. The term \\'Sutra\\', derived from the Sanskrit \\'Sütra\\', means thread or appropriate. All teachings, principles, explanations, and practices spoken by the Buddha are threaded within, like a string threading together all pearls into a necklace without letting any fall out. The teachings are suitable to the intellectual level and capacity of all beings, hence called appropriate. In summary, the Canon is a repository containing all teachings, threading together all meanings of the Buddha\\'s words, suitable for all beings.</p>\\n        <p>Called the Three Baskets, they are the Scripture Basket, the Discipline Basket, and the Treatise Basket.</p>\\n        <p>The Scripture Basket includes all teachings, principles, explanations, and practices spoken by the Blessed One, except those belonging to the Discipline and Treatise Baskets. The Discipline Basket contains all precepts for monastics and lay followers. The Treatise Basket includes all treatises aimed at explaining and expanding the Scripture Basket\\'s meanings. Because the Discipline and Treatise share the same intention with the Scriptures and originate from them, they are also included in the Great Canon.</p>\\n\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Original Great Canon</title>\\n            <p>Immediately after the Buddha\\'s passing, his disciples undertook the task of compiling the Great Canon. According to records in the Cullavagga, still extant in Pali, after the Buddha\\'s passing, some followers foolishly celebrated, thinking they would no longer be bound by his precepts. One of the Buddha\\'s great disciples, Maha Kassapa, alarmed by this, convened a grand assembly in Rajagaha with 500 saintly disciples to compile the Buddha\\'s teachings and definitively establish the precepts, preventing false teachings from spreading. This was the first compilation. * Compilation is a translation of the Sanskrit \\'Samgiti\\', meaning gathering and reciting, as there were no written texts at the time. It was merely a gathering to recite accurately to prevent any loss. The Buddha\\'s teachings were divided into two parts: doctrine and precepts. The entire Canon later evolved around these two cores. Studying why there are differing doctrines in contemporary texts and how the original Canon was compiled is a challenging task.</p>\\n            <p>The Canon was compiled in two scripts: Pali and Sanskrit. Buddhism spread into two regions: Southern Buddhism and Northern Buddhism. Southern Buddhism centered around Sri Lanka and gradually spread to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Northern Buddhism, centered in Tibet, Nepal, and China, dispersed to Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. When comparing Southern and Northern Buddhism, many differences are evident. Southern Buddhism used scriptures written in Pali, while Northern Buddhism used Sanskrit. This distinction is quite clear.</p>\\n\\n            <subsection>\\n                <title>Editing Buddhist Texts in Pali</title>\\n                <p>According to \"Dīpavaṃsa\", during the reign of King Abhayavarman in Sri Lanka, a large assembly was held at a significant temple to transcribe and compile the Buddha\\'s teachings. This compilation relied entirely on the most accurate traditions from ancient times. It should be noted that many people memorized the Buddha\\'s teachings word for word. The entire Canon was written in the Sinhalese national language around the first century BCE. Four centuries later, in the early fifth century CE, a person from Magadha in Central India traveled to Sri Lanka and undertook the translation of these texts into the Indian national language, Pali. Once this translation was completed, the complete Canon was available in Pali. Subsequently, Pali scriptures were disseminated unceasingly; today, they are in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand. In Thailand, in 1893, King Chulalongkorn, on the occasion of his 25th coronation anniversary, ordered the full edition in Siamese for the clergy and scholars in the country and for international scholarly societies.</p>\\n            </subsection>\\n        </subsection>\\n    </subsection>\\n</section>\\n\\n<notes>\\nThis text discusses significant figures in Vietnamese literature and history, such as Nguyễn Công Trứ, Nguyễn Du, Cao Bá Quát, and Trần Tế Xương, highlighting their philosophical differences and the unique role of faith in Nguyễn Công Trứ\\'s success. It moves forward to introduce and define Buddhist literature, emphasizing the importance of the Great Canon in Buddhist studies and distinguishing between Southern and Northern Buddhism. Historically, the text provides a glimpse into the religious and cultural dynamics of the time, revealing the efforts to preserve and transmit Buddhist teachings through various scripts and regions.\\n</notes>\\n\\n<translation-notes>\\n- \"Nhân cách kém hèn\" was translated as \"those of lesser character\" to convey a sense of humility or modesty.\\n- “Kiên nhẫn giữ đạo” is translated as \"patience in maintaining the path,\" emphasizing persistence.\\n- \"Vi nhân bất phú\" translates to \"to be human is not to be wealthy,\" a phrase reflecting spiritual over material values.\\n- \"Đức tín tưởng mãnh liệt\" is rendered as \"intense faith,\" highlighting the strength of Nguyễn Công Trứ\\'s belief.\\n- The term \"Đại Tạng Kinh\" or \"Great Canon\" refers to the comprehensive body of Buddhist scriptures.\\n- \"Khế-Kinh\" and \"Sütra\" reflect the idea of threading and suitability, key concepts in understanding the role of these teachings.\\n- The term \"Tam-Tạng-Kinh\" or \"Three Baskets\" is preserved as a vital classification of Buddhist scriptures.\\n</translation-notes>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n   <title>Visit to Buddhist Sites</title>\\n   <subsection>\\n      <title>Editorship of Buddhist Texts in Sanskrit</title>\\n      <p>\\n         The question of whether the Buddhist texts in Sanskrit predate or postdate the Pali texts is a complex issue that remains difficult to thoroughly investigate. We can be certain that by the second century, approximately 600 years after the Buddha\\'s parinirvana, the Sanskrit Buddhist canon was already fully circulated. It is possible that the Sanskrit texts existed before the Pali texts.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         The discovery of Sanskrit scriptures occurred quite late. Among Western scholars who contributed to the search for Sanskrit scriptures, we must first mention Mr. Hodgson. He was an Englishman who often traveled to Nepal for research. In 1822, he collected a total of 380 handwritten Sanskrit scriptures to supply to Western scholars. This caused a sensation in the academic world; until then, people only knew about the Buddhist texts in Pali and had no knowledge of the Sanskrit canon. The impact of this discovery sparked a wave of scholarly interest. In 1845, the French scholar Burnouf published the book <i>Introduction à l\\'Histoire du Bouddhisme indien</i> (An Introduction to the History of Indian Buddhism), and in 1852, the book <i>Le lotus de la Bonne loi</i>, a translation of the Lotus Sutra, was released. These were the first echoes of this discovery.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Besides collecting the sacred Sanskrit scriptures, Burnouf also authored many valuable works necessary for research. In 1784, he published <i>Essays on the Language, Literature, and Religion of Nepal and Tibet</i>.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         After Mr. Hodgson, another Englishman, D. Wright, continued this endeavor. From 1873 to 1876, he worked tirelessly to collect an additional 320 Sanskrit texts. Moreover, he discovered many ancient Brahmanical teachings. This illustrious achievement brought fame to Wright, and based on his results, professors at Cambridge University compiled and published in 1883 a valuable catalog: <i>Catalogue of the Buddhist Sanskrit Manuscripts in the University Library</i>. This catalog contained abundant materials, including historical annals of Nepal and comprehensive collections of ancient Sanskrit scripts.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         <author>Thạc Đức</author>\\n         <i>To be continued</i>\\n      </p>\\n   </subsection>\\n   <subsection>\\n      <title>Vietnamese Buddhism</title>\\n      <subtitle>Report on the Visit to Buddhist Sites</subtitle>\\n      <author>By Venerable Thiện Hòa</author>\\n      <p>\\n         As announced in the press, the Buddhist community of Pakistan extended an invitation to Vietnamese Buddhists to attend the 2500th anniversary celebration of the Buddha\\'s enlightenment according to the Indian calendar, held in Pakistan. I was included in the delegation attending this event.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         The journey from Saigon to Pakistan, if taken directly, lasts only 10 hours. On the day of our departure, we boarded the 6:30 AM flight. The plane flew over Phnom Penh, through Siem Reap, and arrived in Bangkok at 11:30 AM. There, we were greeted by staff from the Vietnamese Embassy and taken to the embassy to rest, as the next flight to Burma (Myanmar) was at 5:30 PM that evening. Upon arriving in Burma, we had to rest at the terminal for half an hour before proceeding to Calcutta (India). We had to rest in Calcutta because it was quite late, past 10 PM. The next morning at 8 AM, the plane took us to East Pakistan, arriving at 10 AM.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         In Pakistan, we were welcomed and escorted to a pre-arranged room to have lunch and rest until 2:30 PM, at which point we attended the ceremony.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         The ceremony was held on a floor of the stadium. There was an exhibition of images depicting Buddhist sites. Behind the exhibition area was a straw house supported by bamboo columns, over 50 meters long and approximately 25 meters wide, serving as a hall for attendees.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         An estimated 8,000 people, both men and women, attended. On behalf of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association, I delivered a speech in Vietnamese, which was then translated into English by Venerable Phúc Tuệ, also known as Quảng Độ, followed by a translation into Chinese by a layperson. We presented a bronze statue of Amitabha Buddha from the Vietnam Buddhist Association to the Buddhist community in Pakistan. Venerable Visuddha-nanda Mahathéro, the Chief President, accepted the gift on behalf of the Pakistani Buddhist community. Everyone stood up, joined their palms together, and expressed their respect and prayed for a strengthened relationship between Vietnamese and Pakistani Buddhism.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Following this, an Italian monk representing Myanmar Buddhism shared some thoughts. Monks and laypeople took turns expressing their spiritual sentiments until the ceremony concluded at 6:30 PM.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         After the ceremony, we were invited to the Buddhist Temple. The temple had a hall, and in front of the worship hall, a long mat was laid for the monks to sit. Lay Buddhists came to pay their respects to the monks, offering pairs of candles and then touching their foreheads with their hands to show reverence before stepping back.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         The monks placed the candles on a plate and lit them all, symbolizing a prayer for blessings.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         We retired at 10 PM. The following morning, a procession of the Buddha statue took place from 8 AM to 10 AM. Thanks to a set of images of Buddha processions from Saigon that we brought along, we suggested to the East Pakistani laypeople to replicate the arrangement for that day\\'s ceremony. Consequently, the Buddha procession in East Pakistan was more ceremoniously organized than in Calcutta. In Calcutta, the procession involved monks, laypeople, all on vehicles moving too swiftly for anyone to keep pace. Moreover, the procession was accompanied by military bands, creating a lively atmosphere.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         In the evening, we participated in the ceremony similar to the previous day. As per the program, that evening was supposed to feature a film about the life of the Buddha to conclude the ceremony. However, due to rain, the screening was canceled, marking the end of the Enlightenment celebration.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         In all four provinces of Pakistan, similar ceremonies were organized. Buddhism in Pakistan is just beginning to be revived, and the 2500th Enlightenment celebration was the first of its kind on Pakistani soil, organized by the Buddhist Society there. Being the first celebration, there were many shortcomings and it was not very thorough. To organize the event, they started preparations from February to May in the Gregorian calendar, and despite receiving support from the Pakistani government amounting to 10,000 Rupees and raising an additional 20,000 Rupees, they could only construct a ceremonial hall with a thatched roof and bamboo columns.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         The population of East Pakistan is around five million, whereas West Pakistan has about 12 million people, totaling roughly 17 million across both regions. Buddhism in the four provinces of East Pakistan has 300 temples, 600 monks, 20,000 adherents, and 29 schools teaching Pali language. Pali is also taught in government public schools.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Monks in Pakistan have never engaged in alms-begging. In the city of Chittagong, devoted followers donate money, and the temples hire cooks to prepare offerings for the monks. In village temples, each household takes turns once a day to cook and offer food at the temple.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Sacred relics, known as Sarira, have two types: opaque and translucent. The Sarira given to Vietnamese Buddhism by Venerable Narada was opaque, whereas the one we revered at the Shudasshace Vehas Temple was very clear, like a gemstone.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         In Pakistan, people do not produce beef, buffalo, or pork; they mainly consume goat and chicken meat.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         An interesting phenomenon is the domesticated crows and rooks found perched on doorsteps like pets. Upon inquiry, we learned that in this region, people do not hunt or consume birds, so these birds have a friendly attitude towards humans and do not fear them like in our country.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Lay Buddhists in East Pakistan generally resemble their Vietnamese counterparts. They are very devout and observe proper etiquette towards the monks. When entering a monk\\'s room, they leave their shoes at the door, bow once before seeking counsel, and touch their foreheads with their hands after touching the monks’ feet as a sign of respect, before standing aside to listen to the monks\\' teachings.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         After the ceremony on May 28, we were invited by Dr. Sarmanta\\'s family to a meal in a newly constructed house with a dining room prepared (with patterned cloth laid over cushions). Before the meal, he offered each monk a glass of water, followed by a large plate. In the plate, rice was placed in the center, surrounded by clusters of food and desserts. Seeing my discomfort with eating by hand, the host provided a spoon and fork. In Pakistan, they greatly enjoy dairy products, so most of the dishes contained butter or milk, to which we were unaccustomed.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         After the meal, Dr. Sarmanta\\'s wife brought out a tray with three yellow robes, offering them to the three Vietnamese monks. Venerable Visuddhananda Mahathero led a prayer. In return, I offered a blessing for Dr. Sarmanta\\'s family, which Venerable Phúc Tuệ translated into Indian, and the family listened intently, appearing deeply moved.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         On the following day (May 29), another learned layperson invited us to their home for a vegetarian meal, equally as ceremonious as the previous day.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         At 5 PM that day (May 29), upon receiving funds sent by the Vice President of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association and after exchanging currency, many monks and laypeople gathered to see us off at the airport, presenting the Vietnamese Buddhist Association with a beautiful white Buddha statue. I delivered a heartfelt farewell speech.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         As the plane took off, we waved to each other with affection until the aircraft was out of sight. At that moment, I felt that as Buddhists, living in the spirit of Dharma, even though we are separated by two distant lands, meeting each other fosters affection and regard as if we were siblings of one family. Now, as some stay and others depart, it feels difficult to part. Yet, due to our duties, everyone had to set aside personal feelings.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         An hour and a half later, the plane landed in Calcutta. After completing paperwork, we went to the lodging place for Burmese monks. The lodging had three floors, with the upper floor dedicated to Buddha worship while the rest served as accommodations for Burmese monks on their travels.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         After leaving our luggage at the lodging, we exchanged money and purchased train tickets to visit the Bodhi tree site. The train departed at 8:30 PM and arrived in Gaya at 5:30 AM. We then had to travel an additional 15 kilometers by rickshaw to reach the Bodhi tree site, where the Buddha attained enlightenment in ancient times.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Upon arrival, we looked up at the grand stupa, approximately 60 meters tall and 32 meters wide. In front of the stupa was a square entrance within an A-shaped frame. Moving about ten meters inside was a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni, made of stone and approximately 1.5 meters tall. In front of the Buddha was a square, round-topped stone pillar for placing offerings, a bronze incense holder, and a line of flower offering bowls to the right.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         On the upper tier of the stupa was also a Buddha statue, approximately 1.2 meters tall. Each corner of the stupa had two spotlights illuminating the stupa\\'s peak. This stupa was erected by King Asoka (A Dục) approximately 200 years after the Buddha\\'s parinirvana; he was a king genuinely devoted to the Dharma.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Alongside building this stupa, he also ordered the construction of 84,000 smaller stupas throughout the five regions of India.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         In the thirteenth century, when Islamic forces conquered India, these smaller stupas were all destroyed.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Today, the Nehru government has gathered damaged stone statues and remaining stupa tops, placing them on platforms around this large stupa.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         To the right of the stupa, about 60 meters away, is a square lotus pond, approximately 50 meters on each side and about ten meters deep, with cement railings surrounding it. We arrived when workers were building steps from the surface to the bottom of the pond. This stupa site has now been thoroughly renovated and expanded, complete with lighting and water facilities.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Four meters behind the stupa is the Bodhi tree, where the Buddha meditated for 49 days, attaining the fruit of enlightenment.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Previously, Prince Mahinda Thera, son of King Asoka (A Dục), upon ordination, took a branch of the Bodhi tree from this corner to plant in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). When Islamic invaders arrived, they destroyed the original Bodhi tree. Later, to preserve a memory, people took a branch from the Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka and replanted it at the original site. The current Bodhi tree behind the stupa is about 4.8 meters in girth.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         Approximately 200 meters behind the stupa is the Bodhi Society Hall. This building was established by Mr. Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan. After completing his education, he visited India to see the Buddhist sites and, observing the dilapidation allowed by the British government, vowed to dedicate his life to restoring Buddhism.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         At that time, he campaigned for the Buddhist Society to have representation in the Indian Parliament. He requested the British government to renovate the Buddhist sites and support the Bodhi Society, to which the British government consented.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         During an International Buddhist Conference in the United States, he attended the meeting. Mrs. Foster Mary, an American, upon hearing his vow, offered one million dollars to help him restore the Buddhist sites and establish the Bodhi Society. As a layperson, he engaged in Buddhist activities until over 60 years old, and near the end of his life, he took monastic vows.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n         He also vowed to return in his next life to continue fulfilling his incomplete vow.\\n      </p>\\n   </subsection>\\n   <notes>\\n      This section illustrates the intricate collaboration and exchange between Vietnamese and international Buddhist communities during the mid-20th century.

       " '<section>\\n    <title>Buddhism and Science</title>\\n    <p>\\n        Next to the Bodhi Society is a Tibetan temple, built by Tibetan monks. Currently, there are Chinese monks practicing Tantric Buddhism living there. Beside the temple, there is a guesthouse for visitors to stay.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        By the roadside, behind a plot of land with a stupa, there is a Chinese nunnery known as \"Chung-Hoa Great Enlightenment Temple,\" built by a Chinese nun. The couplets in front of the temple are:\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        The Great Vehicle transports the three wheels, universally saving sentient beings beyond eons\\n        All propagate the wondrous Dharma, the Vajra stupa revives the bridge.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        This temple venerates a stone Buddha statue over a meter tall. This stone statue was discovered when people were digging a trench in front of the temple, and the residing nun brought it in to be painted and worshipped.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        For a long time, I have desired to visit the Nairanjana River of our Buddhist followers. The sacred river where, in the past, the Buddha, after using milk, placed his bowl, which floated upstream; the historical river that once washed away the dust from the Buddha\\'s body before he sat under the Bodhi tree to attain enlightenment.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Here it is, the historical river appearing before my eyes. Along the road to the Bodhi stupa, about 100 meters from the white sandy bank, the river flows sluggishly. The river is very shallow now, and people can cross without needing a boat, just by rolling up their pants. The scenery here is very simple. The river is shallow. Crossing the river needs no boat. Looking at the river, I feel my heart at ease. Just that is enough to fulfill my wish!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        After visiting the Bodhi stupa, we returned to the residence of the Buddhist monks at Dien-Dien. We briefly inquired about the current state of Buddhism in Dien-Dien. The monks informed us that the government of Dien-Dien is very devotedly supporting Buddhism in both spiritual and material aspects.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        There are about 80,000 monks, an estimated 10 million followers, and approximately 4,000 temples in Dien-Dien.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        The monks practice meditation from the time they receive Sa-di ordination until they reach the age of twenty. \\n    </p>\\n    <p>(To be continued)</p>\\n    <p> \\n        <b>BUDDHISM</b>\\n        <br/>\\n        and\\n        <br/>\\n        <b>SCIENCE</b>\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        (Continued)\\n    </p>\\n    <subsection>\\n        <p>\\n            b) On the contrary, there are some fellow practitioners who, whenever Buddhism is mentioned, associate it with science. In a small book written for the youth, I read: *The Surangama Sutra, a very scientific sutra...* At a vegetarian banquet in Hanoi, a layperson lectured on the Amitabha Sutra to the students, stating that this sutra contains philosophy, astronomy, geology, and many other sciences. The reason for saying this is because the Surangama Sutra mentions the structure of the universe, convex lenses to gather fire, and methods to filter water to prevent subtle beings (germs), while the Amitabha Sutra speaks of a Pure Land with a special, extremely magnificent scene. Then, these individuals are willing to assert that Buddhism preceded science, speaking of the boundless world, subtle beings, and so on... Such methods of teaching the Dharma can occasionally be somewhat beneficial, but they can hardly avoid major misunderstandings borne from shallow scientific understanding. Taking a few minor events from the scriptures and attributing them to a scientific nature seems rather narrow-minded. Such actions are akin to interpreting so-called prophecies in holy books after a few similar events have occurred. If we assume that the Buddha intended to refer to germs when advising disciples to filter water before drinking, then how can we explain scientifically the Buddha\\'s statement about the sun circling Mount Meru? We should not lean too heavily on such forced comparisons. Doing so would be like suddenly using science as a measure to assess Buddhism, which is the greatest error, for science does not possess absolute, immutable value.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Doing so, we show that we do not understand the scope of science, nor do we understand what science truly is. There was a time when we learned in school that steam rises, condenses into clouds, and then the clouds gather to form heavy raindrops. Those explanations, with all the clarity of reasoning based on experiments, were the starting point for our respect for science. If later on, we had no opportunity to study science thoroughly, we might easily believe that everything science teaches is immutable truth, and that by applying this method to every field, we would surely find the truth. Never before has science become such a trend, a fashion item; everywhere, people talk about science. A group of writers assert that our people need to quickly adopt scientific methods because, according to them, only these methods can lead people to real knowledge. Their words are somewhat laudable, but unfortunately, they understand science in a narrow and shallow way. They apply the so-called scientific method to any field: in a research book about the Tale of Kieu, they have scientifically proven (1) that Kieu was a woman with jaundice, with yellow skin, wet eyes, a certain gait, or such dreams, describing Kieu as if they had seen her themselves.\\n            Science reaching such a degree would indeed be a unique wonder!\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Those off-topic words aim to express the excessive misuse of science, to show fellow practitioners that we need to be cautious when comparing science with Buddhism. Using minor scientific facts to defend Buddhism is very harmful because these facts change constantly and rapidly. Previously, we spoke of elements, now we speak of electrons; previously, we focused on separate parts, now we focus on the general aspect; previously, we spoke of continuous matter, now we say matter and energy are discontinuous. In the development of science, these facts are always shifting. Any theory inadvertently clinging to them will quickly collapse along with them. Thus, I am very concerned when I see preachers often use science as a tool to lead people into the path. They focus too much on trivial details and fail to grasp the general principles. Therefore, their reasoning is really fragile and forced. Once the Amitabha Sutra has become a scientific sutra, what book remains unscientific? Among the myriad Dharma gates of Buddhism, the Pure Land gate is perhaps very rare because it relies solely on absolute, unconditional faith in the Buddha\\'s power. To forcefully attach it to science seems excessively contrived.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Because of the fear that the aforementioned issues are spreading increasingly, I am not hesitant to present to you the nature and scope of science, based on my limited knowledge. From there, you will clearly see in which areas we should compare Buddhist studies and science.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            THE SCIENTIST\\'S PERSPECTIVE: Previously, we mentioned that science is a system of thought representing the human mind\\'s response to phenomena. Although this is not necessarily a definition of science, it is sufficient to prevent certain prejudices. People often think of science as an obvious law in the universe discovered by scholars. In their view, these laws have an absolute nature, existing independently, whether or not humans are on this earth. To put it more clearly, for example, they think that whether we exist or not, the stars still move according to the scientific laws of Galileo, Newton, and attract with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The more of these obvious laws are discovered, the closer people\\'s understanding of the universe approaches completion.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            The scientist\\'s perspective is not like that. It does not involve finding an absolute, obvious law. Their position is not like a detective uncovering a secret case. The detective has a ready-made secret: For their profession, it is absolute. They only need to find suspicious traces, gather them, find a connection between these traces, and then, according to their reasoning, gradually discover the truth. Scientists cannot do so. They do not have a definite secret lying in the shadows that they must create themselves, and then seek it out. Observing phenomena in the universe, scientists see a harmonious rhythm, cause leading to effect, one phenomenon often linked to another, without deviation. From there, they develop the belief that there must be a connection between the phenomena they observe: They try to establish—on their own—the connection. Whether this connection truly exists in an absolute way between the phenomena, they do not care. What matters to them is that the connection fits a large part of their later observations. To make it clearer, let me give an example: Before me, there is a clock, and I see the hands moving, the ticking sound regularly. If I were a detective wanting to know what the clock really is, I would carefully observe and then use reasoning to guess that there must be gears, springs, etc. According to that prediction, I would find the screws, open the clock to see if my predictions were correct. Now, suppose we have a clock that cannot be opened. If I were a scientist standing before such a clock, what would I do? I would listen to the ticking, watch the hands move, predict that the hands surely move according to some law. After careful observation, I would create laws about the long hand, the short hand, the sound, and then apply these laws to create long hands, short hands, sounds myself, or use the sounds and movements of the hands in other tasks. If the hands I make closely resemble the real hands, and the applications do not bring about too many contradictions, I can consider these laws correct and consolidate all these separate laws into a broader, more inclusive one. This comprehensive law is my current truth about the clock. The more meticulous the observation, the more sophisticated the tools I use, the further and more comprehensively this truth advances, but I can never know—and do not need to know, if I only stay within the realm of science—what the truth inside that closed clock is.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Similarly, the universe is like a closed clock to scientists. Before the vast, mysterious universe, scientists study a part of phenomena, link them with a law they create, and then test this law. They further include these laws into a larger comprehensive law covering a larger portion of phenomena. The ideal limit in that broadening scope is what they call objective truth.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            METHOD: To reach that objective truth, scientists use the experimental method, relying on meticulous measurement. When scientists want to observe a phenomenon, they first eliminate what is not related to that phenomenon, then conduct many measurement experiments, and record all results. Among these results, through thinking, they create a connection, formulate a law. But they do not yet acknowledge that law. They apply it to dependent phenomena to see if it is correct, and they are only satisfied when it fits a large part of the phenomena they observe.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Regarding the measurement mentioned above, it is worth explaining a bit more. Scientists consider measurement extremely important: According to Henri Poincare, outside of measurement, there is no science. Thomson, also known as Lord Kelvin, said that something he cannot measure has no meaning for him. Because observation only reveals quality, whereas measurement reveals quantity, allowing us to express experimental results in numbers.\\n        </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n</section>\\n\\n<notes>\\nThis text explores the relationship between Buddhism and science, cautioning against the superficial comparison of Buddhist teachings with scientific facts.

       " '<section>\\n    <title>Spring of the Path</title>\\n    <p>\\n        Mathematical formulas often accompany measurements, always containing some degree of uncertainty. When measuring a table, for instance, I might say the table is one meter long with a relative error of 1/100, meaning it could be between 0.99m and 1.01m, but I can never know its exact length. The more precise the measurements, the more comprehensive the laws discovered can encompass various phenomena. Today, science can measure with a relative error of one part in ten million for length and even more accurately for weight, which allows for the exploration of subtle phenomena, paving the way to a rich understanding of quantum concepts.\\n    </p>\\n    <subtitle>SCOPE</subtitle>\\n    <p>\\n        Based on measurements, science has a very distinct scope. It only examines phenomena within the realm of sensory verification, whether direct or indirect. For instance, to observe invisible rays, scientists find a way to make them visible on photographic paper or chemical plates. Beyond this scope, a scientist does not concern themselves. This statement is not meant to criticize their perspective as narrow but to clearly distinguish what Science is. Furthermore, this scope is already vast, and even a small part of it can occupy the minds of a generation. Once this scope has been thoroughly explored, how can one help but be moved to consider issues beyond it? For even scientists are human, with questions about the mysterious essence of life. Therefore, it is no surprise that science has become the foundation for profound philosophies that require more than just reading popular books; indeed, one must study some advanced mathematics and physics.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        These philosophies not only apply new scientific discoveries but also largely rely on the unique characteristics of science.

The delay is because I was busy arranging accommodation and finding a school. Everything is settled now, uncle. I am currently staying with a friend in Dakao. This friend studied in Hue before, attending the same class as me. His name is Hien, and he has a very amiable nature. Initially, I planned to go to An-Quang temple and ask Master Minh-Tue for help finding a place, but I happened to meet Hien on the street. When Hien learned I was looking for lodging, he immediately invited me to his home and asked his parents if I could stay there happily. Hien\\'s parents were very welcoming and insisted I stay. I was hesitant, but Hien assured me that I could pay for my stay, so there was no need to worry.</p>\\n    <p>Thus, I have a place to stay and a good friend. As for school, Hien helped me find one. It turned out that Hien is also in his second year, like me, and advised me to attend the same school as him. I audited classes for two days and found the professors to be excellent, so I officially enrolled. The school is Phuong-Duc, right in the city\\'s center.</p>\\n    <p>Yesterday was Sunday, so I visited An Quang temple but could not meet Master Minh Tue. I heard he was busy teaching the Dharma to the Buddhist family at Phuoc-Hoa temple. I asked a novice monk to show me around the temple. It turns out this is a Buddhist school, uncle.</p>\\n    <p>According to the novice monk, this temple was built in 1949. Being in the city, it does not have the almost absolute tranquility I found in the temples in Hue. Here, I found many familiar things: the gentle demeanor of the monks, the friendly and kind smiles of the young monks, the soothing atmosphere filled with the faint scent of incense... Previously, I thought that leaving Hue meant I could no longer experience the serene, mystical hours under the beloved roofs of Bao Quoc and Tu Dam temples. Here, I realized that throughout Vietnam, everywhere is illuminated by the light of Compassion, and genuine Buddhists can create a peaceful atmosphere to live under the Compassionate Buddha’s shadow.</p>\\n    <p>As I mentioned, An Quang temple is also a Buddhist school, like Bao Quoc temple. Thus, there are three Buddhist schools in Vietnam: Hue, Nhatrang, and Saigon. I heard that in the South, there are two other Buddhist schools: Van Thu Buddhist Institute, managed by the Northern Buddhist Congregation, and Giac-Nguyen Buddhist School, supervised by Venerable Hanh Tru. On a free day, I will visit those places, uncle, and I will tell you about them later.</p>\\n    <p>Now, let me continue talking about An-Quang temple, the Buddhist school of Southern Vietnam.</p>\\n    <p>When I first entered the temple gate, I immediately felt joyful and recognized many familiar features. The front hall resembled Tu Dam temple exactly, and surprisingly, there were still the same couplets from Tu Dam temple that one day, standing before the temple gate, you explained to me:</p>\\n    <p><i>* The Buddha\\'s true teaching governs, with infinite life, infinite light, infinite virtues,</i></p>\\n    <p><i>« Study the true meaning, listen truly, think truly, practice truly * </i></p>\\n    <p>I wandered to the guest house and there, I was received by the Abbot for almost half an hour. Afterward, the Abbot asked a novice monk to show me around the temple. To the right of the main hall is a long building with two classrooms, filled with young monks. Outside, many bicycles were parked, and I learned that besides the resident students at the Buddhist institute, many monks from other temples also come here to study.</p>\\n    <p>The third-year class was having a lesson on Buddhist philosophy. Some senior monk whose name I do not know was teaching on the Mahayana doctrines. Standing outside, I eavesdropped for about five minutes. The teacher\\'s voice was clear yet gentle, and I wanted to listen indefinitely if not for the novice monk by my side. Passing by the second-year class, I encountered a literature lesson; the young monks were studying the \"Chinh - phu - ngam,\" uncle. Thus, besides Buddhist philosophy, the young monks also study common subjects like literature, science, history... I also like this because I believe the young monks should have fundamental knowledge in all fields. I was taken to visit the monks\\' quarters. It was a long, spacious building, with monks’ desks lined up in two straight rows. Each monk had a large compartment for tools and books. Each monk had their own bed, coat rack, and desk. The arrangement was neat and orderly; I imagined that even secular dormitories might not be better.</p>\\n    <p>I visited the distribution room for scriptures and read through the catalog. One day, I will acquire some books to send to you. This distribution room is a room on the left side of the ancestral house. It seems the ancestral house was recently completed; it has two floors.

The main hall was impressively solemn! The statue of Buddha Shakyamuni amazed me immensely. I had never seen such a beautiful statue. His face was calm, full of compassion and wisdom. His sitting posture was strong and majestic. A statue that embodies all three virtues: compassion, wisdom, and courage is truly rare.

Personally, when I first encountered Southern Buddhism, I found it not difficult at all. Sitting in Ân-Quang Pagoda, talking with a student monk, I felt as if I were sitting within the great family of Buddhists.

With the cooperation of the Southern Vietnam Buddhist Radio and the Northern Vietnam Buddhist Radio in the South, we believe that the unified Buddhist broadcast will be organized swiftly and will achieve excellent results.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>A VIETNAMESE BUDDHIST INSTITUTE WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN NHA TRANG:</b> The Sangha Association and the Middle Region Buddhist Association are dedicating efforts to build an extensive Buddhist school in Nha Trang, named the \"Vietnamese Buddhist Institute in Central Vietnam.\" At present, the energies of both Administrative Committees are focused on this endeavor. With the strong support of Buddhists nationwide, the institute is sure to be completed in a short time.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>ANOTHER BUDDHIST SCHOOL HAS BEEN BUILT IN TRA VINH:</b> Under the guidance and support of the Southern Vietnam Sangha Association and the Southern Vietnam Buddhist Association Management Committee, the Tra Vinh Province Buddhist Association has built a Buddhist school at Phuoc Hoa Pagoda. A first-year class of nearly 30 novice monks has commenced. This Buddhist school is a branch of the Southern Vietnam Buddhist School. Among the teachers sent by the central administration, we see Thay Truong Lac and Thay Tinh Duc.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>NAM VIET NUN ASSEMBLY IS BEING ORGANIZED:</b> The Nam Viet Nun Assembly is being organized for October 6-7, 1956, at Hue Lam Pagoda, Cholon, under the guidance of the Southern Vietnam Sangha Association.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>THE FORMATION OF THE CA MAU PROVINCE SANGHA ASSOCIATION IS IMPENDING:</b> Almost all provinces have established associations and maintain contact with the Central Administration. The formation of the Ca Mau Province Sangha Association is underway. Perhaps Long Xuyen, Rach Gia, and Chau Doc will follow suit.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>CONSTRUCTION OF THE XA LOI PAGODA IS UNDERWAY:</b> The fund raised for the construction of Xa Loi Pagoda has reached two million dong. The construction work is progressing steadily. The Southern Vietnam Buddhist Association Management Committee is working with all their heart and strength. Buddhist activities await the contributions of all benevolent fellow practitioners.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <b>THE DHARMA PROPAGATION WORK IS VIGOROUSLY ADVANCING:</b> Throughout the country, lecturers and novice monks have dedicated their utmost efforts to the work of Dharma Propagation. The spirit of study and practice among fellow practitioners in provinces, for example in Quang Tri, is extraordinarily high. The same is true in the South, where doctrine classes organized in provinces are enthusiastically supported by the Buddhist public. The Unified Buddhist Journal has been warmly received in every locality.\\n    </p>\\n    <notes>\\n        The text references several significant developments in Vietnamese Buddhism during the mid-20th century, such as the establishment of Buddhist schools and the organization of broadcasting efforts to unify Buddhist voices across the nation. These activities reflect the broader movement towards a unified Vietnamese Buddhism and the increased involvement of lay practitioners.\\n    </notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        The original Vietnamese terms include \"Tổng Hội\" (General Association), \"Phật giáo Việt-Nam\" (Journal of Vietnamese Buddhism), \"buổi phát thanh\" (broadcast), \"Giáo hội Tăng già\" (Sangha Association), \"Phật học viện Việt Nam\" (Vietnamese Buddhist Institute), and \"Chùa Xá Lợi\" (Xa Loi Pagoda).

Techniques like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning will gain prominence, making AI systems more adaptable and capable of complex tasks with less data.\\n\\n2. **Explainability and Transparency**: With increased AI integration in critical decision-making processes, there will be heightened demand for models that provide clear explanations of their outputs. This aligns with growing regulatory pressures and the need for trustworthiness in AI systems.\\n\\n3. **Ethical AI and Governance**: The focus will intensify on creating frameworks for ethical AI, addressing issues like bias, privacy, and accountability. Companies and governments will work towards establishing clearer policies and standards for AI deployment.\\n\\n4. **Edge AI**: The shift toward edge computing involves deploying AI technologies directly on devices (\"on the edge\") instead of relying solely on centralized cloud systems. This approach reduces latency, improves privacy, and can be more cost-effective, driving broader IoT and real-time analytics applications.\\n\\n5. **Democratization of AI**: Tools and platforms that make AI more accessible to non-experts are advancing, lowering the barriers to entry in AI development and implementation. This democratization will enable more businesses to leverage AI, fueling innovation across industries.\\n\\n6. **Specialized AI Applications**: AI will continue to make inroads into specialized applications such as healthcare (driving diagnostics and personalized medicine), finance (automating trading and fraud detection), and autonomous systems (from vehicles to drones).\\n\\n7. **Hybrid AI Models**: Combining various AI approaches, such as integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks, will gain traction. These hybrid models aim to leverage the strengths of different methodologies, paving the way for more versatile and powerful AI systems.\\n\\n8. **Collaboration between AI and Human Experts**: Rather than replacing human roles, AI systems will increasingly be designed to augment human capabilities, assisting experts in making more informed decisions, and streamlining workflows.\\n\\n9. **Sustainability**: There will be a stronger emphasis on reducing the environmental impact of AI, particularly in relation to energy-intensive training processes. Research into more sustainable AI practices will expand, focusing on efficiency and resource conservation.\\n\\n10. **Increased Focus on Continuous Learning**: AI systems capable of continuous learning will be developed, enabling systems to adapt and evolve as new data and scenarios arise, rather than relying solely on traditional retraining cycles.\\n\\nAs these trends evolve, the field of AI will continue to redefine itself, opening up new possibilities and challenges. Building systems that are not only powerful but also ethical and sustainable will be crucial in shaping the trajectory of AI\\'s immediate future.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1732843026, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7f6be3efb0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=563, prompt_tokens=40, total_tokens=603, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"
