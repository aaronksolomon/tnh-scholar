# TNH Scholar Coding Instructions
Guidance for AI coding agents working in the TNH Scholar repository.

- Highly modular, clean and well documented code, generally preferring strong OO style using classes for most systems.
- Code be easily readable, with excellent spacing and formatting, yet concise in terms of naming and logical construction. 
- Strive to use highest level, most powerful and sophisticated pythonic commercial-professional styles, follow PEP8 protocols.
- Using strongly typed systems. Types should be created where needed.
- Clear and professional google style docstrings
- Data models: prefer pydantic models and pydantic BaseSettings for configurations settings
- Methods and functions should be single acting with a target length of 10-15 lines of code (not including comments)
- Generally writing prototyping code but with expectation to move rapidly toward production level professional grade systems -- extremely robust.
