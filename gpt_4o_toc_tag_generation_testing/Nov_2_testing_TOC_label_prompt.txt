# prompt 1

Below is the opening text for a book. It includes a title and TOC. I'd like to generate metadata tags for each element in the TOC and also add supplemental metadata to the top of the file.

In general tag structure for sections should be as follows:
`<section level="n"><descriptor>item<\section><\descriptor>`

Where level=0 is for general information, level 1 the level for highest level content, level 2 subsections and so on. The descriptors can be any meaningful descriptive word or words for the section. Some descriptor categories are provided below.

Output should be 1) a text block with all metadata inserted, and 2) a code block which gives regexps for matching each type of section.

Descriptor set (which may be enlarged as needed):
`<note> <exercise> <exercise_group> <introduction> <principle> <principle_group>`

Metadata to add:
{'metadata': {'title': 'Transformation and Healing: Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness',
  'author': 'Thich Nhat Hanh',
  'language': 'en',
  'publisher': 'Parallax Press',
  'date': '2006-08-16T15:00:00+00:00'}
