    "# Notebook Management Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides utilities for managing Jupyter notebook files in a development workflow. It helps maintain separate versions of notebooks for version control and local development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Creates `*_local.ipynb` copies of notebooks for local development\n",
    "- Strips output cells from original notebooks for clean version control\n",
    "- Dry-run option to preview changes before execution\n",
    "- Interactive confirmation before applying changes\n",
    "- Safe execution with preview and confirmation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Preview changes (dry run)\n",
    "prep_notebooks(Path(\"./notebooks\"), dry_run=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute changes with confirmation (see last cell block)\n",
    "from tnh_scholar.utils import get_user_confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "dir_to_mod = Path(\"./notebooks\")\n",
    "prep_notebooks(dir_to_mod, dry_run=True)  # Preview changes\n",
    "\n",
    "if get_user_confirmation(\"Proceed with changes? (y/N)\", default=False):\n",
    "    prep_notebooks(dir_to_mod, dry_run=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility implements a safe workflow for notebook management:\n",
    "1. First shows a preview of planned changes (dry run)\n",
    "2. Prompts for user confirmation\n",
    "3. Only executes changes after explicit confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps prevent accidental modifications while maintaining clean notebooks in version control with separate local development copies."
