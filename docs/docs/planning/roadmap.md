└── tutorials/
    ├── basic.md          # (2 hours) Basic usage tutorials
    └── advanced.md       # (4 hours) Advanced patterns
```

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive test documentation
- CI/CD pipeline documentation
- Environment setup guides
- Tutorial series

## Phase 4: Production Deployment
Estimated effort: 4-5 coder-days

**Focus**: Production-ready documentation and maintenance
```
docs/
├── deployment/
│   ├── production.md      # (8 hours) Production deployment
│   ├── monitoring.md      # (4 hours) Monitoring guide
│   └── troubleshooting.md # (8 hours) Production issues
├── user_guide/
│   ├── best_practices.md  # (6 hours) Production usage
│   └── optimization.md    # (4 hours) Performance guide
├── maintenance/
│   ├── upgrades.md       # (4 hours) Upgrade procedures
│   └── backup.md         # (4 hours) Backup/restore
└── examples/
    └── production.md     # (4 hours) Production examples
```

**Key Deliverables**:
- Production deployment guides
- Monitoring and maintenance docs
- Performance optimization guides
- Production-grade examples

## General Guidelines Across Phases

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update with each significant feature addition (1-2 hours per feature)
- Review and refresh documentation monthly (2-4 hours)
- Address documentation issues from user feedback (1-2 hours per issue)

**Quality Maintenance**:
- Regular link checking (automated)
- Example testing (2-4 hours per major version)
- Documentation testing (2-4 hours per major version)

**Each Phase Transition Checklist**:
1. Review and update existing docs (4-8 hours)
2. Plan new documentation needs (2-4 hours)
3. Get user feedback on current docs (2-4 hours)
4. Implement improvements (varies by feedback)

This phased approach allows documentation to grow naturally with the project while maintaining focus on current needs. Time estimates are for documentation work only and assume familiarity with the codebase.
