**[Contributing to TNH Scholar (Prototype Phase)](/development/contributing-prototype-phase.md)** - TNH Scholar is currently in rapid prototype phase, focusing on core functionality and basic usability. We welcome contributions that help validate and improve the prototype implementation.

**[TNH Scholar Design Principles](/development/design-principles.md)** - Architectural patterns, design philosophy, and system organization principles for TNH Scholar development.

**[Fine Tuning Strategy](/development/fine-tuning-strategy.md)** - Strategy outline and development plan for fine-tuning foundation models on Thich Nhat Hanh translations.

**[Git Workflow & Safety Guide](/development/git-workflow.md)** - Safe git practices for TNH Scholar development to prevent data loss

**[Human-AI Software Engineering Principles](/development/human-ai-software-engineering-principles.md)** - This document presents the **Human-AI Software Engineering Principles**, a comprehensive framework that builds upon established **software engineering, architecture, and design principles** from human-only teams and extends them to optimize collaboration between humans and AI agents. Central to this framework is the clear distinction between the **Design Phase** and the **Coding Phase**, each with distinct goals, modes, and workflows. It also addresses challenges such as **context window limitations** and maintaining alignment despite session resets. In addition to general principles, this framework incorporates concrete documentation and planning strategies designed to support long-term, sustainable human-AI collaboration.

**[Improvements / Initial structure](/development/improvements-initial-structure.md)** - Initial high-level view of the TNH Scholar ecosystem.

**[Development Documentation](/development/overview.md)** - Landing page for contributor guides, design principles, and engineering practices for TNH Scholar.

**[Release Workflow](/development/release-workflow.md)** - Automated release process for TNH Scholar with biweekly cadence during rapid prototyping.

**[TNH Scholar Style Guide](/development/style-guide.md)** - Code formatting, naming conventions, and Python standards for TNH Scholar development.

**[TNH Scholar System Design](/development/system-design.md)** - High-level system design describing the cyclical AI processing architecture powering TNH Scholar.
