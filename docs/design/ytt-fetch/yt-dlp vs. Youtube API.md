# YouTube API vs yt-dlp Evaluation

## YouTube Data API (Google Cloud) Approach

### Advantages
1. Official solution with:
   - Stable, documented API
   - Clear rate limits and quotas
   - Service level guarantees
   - Official support channels

2. Additional capabilities:
   - Better metadata access
   - Channel/playlist management
   - Comment access
   - Full YouTube ecosystem integration

### Disadvantages
1. Setup overhead:
   - Requires Google Cloud account
   - API key/credentials management
   - Project setup in Google Cloud Console
   - Quota management

2. Cost considerations:
   - Free tier limits
   - Usage-based pricing
   - Quota costs for transcript access

3. Implementation complexity:
   - OAuth flow for some operations
   - More complex credential management
   - More code to maintain

## Current yt-dlp Approach 

### Advantages
1. Simplicity:
   - No authentication needed
   - Minimal setup
   - Works immediately

2. Cost:
   - Free to use
   - No quota limits
   - No account needed

3. Implementation:
   - Already working solution
   - Minimal code
   - Handles both manual and auto captions

### Disadvantages
1. Unofficial:
   - Could break with YouTube changes
   - No guaranteed support
   - Limited to public video access

## Recommendation

For this project's current needs (transcript downloading from public videos), yt-dlp remains the better choice because:
1. Matches current project scope
2. Zero setup overhead
3. No cost implications
4. Already working solution

Consider YouTube API if project requirements expand to need:
- Private video access
- Channel management
- Commercial deployment
- Service level guarantees
