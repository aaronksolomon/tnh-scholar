# ADR-XXX: Concise Decision Title

One-sentence or short paragraph summarizing the decision.

- **Filename**: `adr-<modulecode><number>-<descriptor>.md` (e.g., `adr-dd01-docs-reorg.md`). Append `-strat` for strategy ADRs.

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Author**: Initial creator of ADR (typically an AI agent or system)

## Context

## Consequences

- **Positive**: List the benefits or opportunities created by this decision.
- **Negative**: Call out trade-offs, risks, or work created.

## Alternatives Considered
