**[ADR-OA01: TNH-Conductor — Provenance-Driven AI Workflow Coordination](adr-oa01-agent-orchestration-strategy.md)** - Strategic architecture for coordinating external AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) through bounded, auditable, human-supervised workflows

**[ADR-OA01.1: TNH-Conductor — Provenance-Driven AI Workflow Coordination (v2)](adr-oa01.1-conductor-strategy-v2.md)** - Strategic architecture for coordinating external AI agents through bounded, auditable, human-supervised workflows with CLI opcode tooling

**[ADR-OA02: Phase 0 Protocol Layer Spike](adr-oa02-phase-0-protocol-spike.md)** - De-risking spike to prove headless agent capture and safety controls for tnh-conductor

**[ADR-OA03: Agent Runner Architecture](adr-oa03-agent-runner-architecture.md)** - Phase 1 architecture for agent execution — kernel + adapter pattern based on OA02 spike learnings

**[ADR-OA03.1: Claude Code Runner](adr-oa03.1-claude-code-runner.md)** - Claude Code execution path — headless print mode only, no interactive/PTY automation

**[ADR-OA03.2: Codex Runner](adr-oa03.2-codex-runner.md)** - Codex execution path — API-first, tool-driven runner for implementation tasks
