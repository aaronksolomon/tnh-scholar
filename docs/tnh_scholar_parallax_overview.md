## 2. Short Project Description (For Quick Understanding)

**TNH‑Scholar** is a long-term digital humanities and AI‑assisted research project dedicated to:

- preserving, organizing, and making searchable the collected works of Thầy.
- supporting translation, annotation, and scholarship across Vietnamese, English, French, and other languages,
- developing tools for practitioners, educators, editors, researchers, and archivists,
- ensuring high accuracy, transparency, and lineage‑faithfulness through provenance tracking and human‑guided AI workflows.

Though it has been joked about, this project is **not** aimed at creating a chatbot to imitate Thầy; though chat based features have the potential to be explored.
It **is** a *scholarly infrastructure*, a set of tools that help people understand, translate, cross‑reference, and preserve the teachings with care.

Core goals:

- A clean, well‑structured, multilingual digital corpus  
- Tools for translation, metadata extraction, and scholarly indexing  
- Research utilities for exploring teachings across decades  
- A foundation for future learning tools, training materials, and editorial workflows  

**The project intends deep respect for the lineage and for the careful stewardship of Thầy’s teachings.**

## 6. TNH‑Scholar Vision & Potential Impact

### 6.1 Background

For decades, Thầy produced a vast corpus of material across multiple languages and formats.  
Much of this exists in:

- scanned PDFs  
- partial digital manuscripts  
- older OCR with errors  
- translations with varying conventions  
- scattered archival sources  

As scholarship grows, and as new generations seek to engage with these teachings, the need for a **structured, unified, lineage‑transparent digital corpus** manifests.

### 6.2 Goals of TNH‑Scholar

- Provide a **faithful, structured representation** of Thầy’s teachings  
- Enable **search, discovery, and thematic exploration**  
- Support **translation workflows** with accuracy and style fidelity  
- Offer **scholarly infrastructure**, not automated interpretation  
- Ensure **ethical, transparent AI usage** firmly grounded in human oversight  
- Preserve text for future generations in durable, well-defined digital formats  

### 6.3 Editorial Benefits

1. **Faster first‑pass translation drafts** with consistent terminology.  
2. **Tools for polishing translations** using side-by-side alignment.  
3. **Reduction in manual OCR cleanup labor** on old sources.  
4. **Structured metadata** enabling easier anthology creation.  
5. **Support for future critical editions** and chronology projects.  

### 6.4 Community Benefits

- Practitioners gain indexed, searchable access to teachings.  
- Teachers gain bilingual tools for quoting or referencing materials.  
- Researchers gain deeper insight into historical development of themes.  

### 6.5 Long-Term Vision

The TNH‑Scholar system becomes the base layer of a future:

- Plum Village Digital Archive  
- Multilingual Study Companion  
- Hermitage Research Tool for monastics  
- Teaching companion for Dharma instructors  
- Preservation system for rare or fragile materials
