# TNH-Scholar: Project Overview for Parallax Press & Plum Village Editorial Community

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides a clear, non-technical introduction to the TNH‑Scholar project for members of Parallax Press and the Plum Village Editorial community. It outlines the project’s goals, current capabilities, potential value to Parallax Press, and areas where collaboration or guidance would be mutually beneficial.

## 2. Short Project Description

**TNH‑Scholar** is a long-term digital humanities and AI‑assisted research project dedicated to:

- preserving, organizing, and making searchable the collected works of Thầy,
- enabling semantic search and discovery across teachings through advanced retrieval techniques,
- supporting translation, annotation, and scholarship across Vietnamese, English, French, and other languages,
- developing tools for practitioners, educators, editors, researchers, and archivists,
- ensuring high accuracy, transparency, and lineage‑faithfulness through provenance tracking and human‑guided AI workflows.

This project is **not** aimed at creating a chatbot to imitate Thầy. Chat based features for research may have the potential to be explored in the future.

The project **is** aimed at creating a *scholarly infrastructure*, a set of tools that help people understand, translate, cross‑reference, and preserve the teachings with care.

Core goals:

- A clean, well‑structured, multilingual digital corpus
- Semantic search and discovery tools enabling practitioners and scholars to explore teachings thematically
- Tools for translation, metadata extraction, and scholarly indexing
- Research utilities for exploring teachings across decades and languages
- A foundation for future learning tools, training materials, and editorial workflows

**The project intends deep respect for the lineage, careful stewardship of Thầy's teachings, and mindful use of AI technologies.**

## 3. Benefits of the Project from an Editorial & Publishing Perspective

### 3.1 Support for Translation & Editing

- High‑accuracy draft translations with full provenance  
- Sentence‑level alignment tools  
- Automated glossaries for Buddhist and Plum Village terminology  
- Tools for comparing versions across languages

### 3.2 Supporting Publication & Editorial Pathways

- A searchable corpus of all published (and historically significant unpublished) materials
- Semantic search capabilities for discovering related teachings, themes, and concepts across the corpus
- Automatic metadata extraction (e.g., footnotes, headings, quotes)
- Tools for preparing anthologies, themed collections, revised editions
- Detection of duplicated text or passages reused across books, talks, or letters

### 3.3 Archival & Preservation

- Clean digital text extracted from aging PDFs and scans  
- OCR correction tools  
- Structured digital formats for long-term storage  
- Cross‑referencing of early journals, handwritten pieces, letters, Dharma talks

### 3.4 Accessibility & Community Benefit

- Resources for educators and sanghas
- Search and discovery tools enabling practitioners to explore teachings by theme, concept, or practice
- Study and research tools for practitioners
- Future bilingual interactive readers or teaching companions
- A foundation for future Plum Village digital learning platforms

> **Note on Search Development**: A prototype sutra search tool is currently being developed at Deer Park Monastery, exploring approaches to searching and discovering teachings within the broader ecosystem of Plum Village digital initiatives. TNH Scholar's knowledge base architecture (see ADR-K01) is designed to support similar search and retrieval capabilities as part of the scholarly infrastructure.

## 4. A Collaborative Vision with Parallax Press

Parallax Press is uniquely positioned to act as:

- **A Beneficiary** — tools that support editing, translation, and publishing.
- **A Contributor** — access to high-quality source materials.

Possible engagement:

- A liaison or small support group
- Review of project direction documents  
- Guidance on terminology, text selection  
- Collaborative long-term vision for Plum Village’s digital future

## 5. High-Level Architecture (Non-Technical Overview)

TNH‑Scholar consists of:

### 5.1 A Clean, Structured Corpus  

Digital text organized into:

- books, chapters, sections, paragraphs  
- talks (audio and video), retreats, interviews, letters  
- early journals (e.g., Vietnamese Buddhist Review collections)

### 5.2 Processing Flows  

Tools for:

- OCR → clean text  
- tagging metadata  
- extracting headings, quotes, footnotes  
- aligning translations  
- classifying themes and concepts

### 5.3 A “GenAI Service”  

A system that runs AI-powered tasks with:

- full transparency  
- reproducible inputs  
- strict provenance (never hidden)  
- human review loops  

### 5.4 User Interfaces

- command line tools for researchers
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- (future) semantic search interfaces for discovering teachings
- (future) VS Code tools for editors/translators
- (future) interactive web portals for reading/study

## 6. TNH‑Scholar Vision & Potential Impact

### 6.1 Background

For decades, Thầy produced a vast corpus of material across multiple languages and formats.  

Much of this exists in:

- scanned documents  
- partial digital manuscripts  
- audio and video recordings
- older OCR with errors  
- translations with varying conventions  
- scattered archival sources  

As scholarship grows, and as new generations seek to engage with these teachings, the need for a **structured, unified, lineage‑transparent digital corpus** manifests.

### 6.2 Goals of TNH‑Scholar

- Provide a **faithful, structured representation** of Thầy's teachings
- Enable **search, discovery, and thematic exploration** across the corpus using semantic retrieval and traditional search methods
- Support **translation workflows** with accuracy and style fidelity
- Offer **scholarly infrastructure**, not automated interpretation
- Ensure **ethical, transparent AI usage** firmly grounded in human oversight
- Preserve text for future generations in durable, well-defined digital formats  

### 6.3 Editorial Benefits

1. **Faster first‑pass translation drafts** with consistent terminology.  
2. **Tools for polishing translations** using side-by-side alignment.  
3. **Reduction in manual OCR cleanup labor** on old sources.  
4. **Structured metadata** enabling easier anthology creation.  
5. **Support for future critical editions** and chronology projects.  

### 6.4 Community Benefits

- Practitioners gain indexed, searchable access to teachings across multiple languages and formats
- Semantic search enables discovery of related teachings, themes, and concepts
- Teachers gain bilingual tools for quoting or referencing materials
- Researchers gain deeper insight into historical development of themes and cross-linguistic connections  

### 6.5 Long-Term Vision

The TNH‑Scholar system becomes the base layer of a future:

- Plum Village Digital Archive with advanced search and discovery capabilities
- Multilingual Study Companion enabling thematic exploration across languages
- Hermitage Research Tool for monastics with semantic search
- Teaching companion for Dharma instructors
- Preservation system for rare or fragile materials
