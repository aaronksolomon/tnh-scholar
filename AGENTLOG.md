# AGENTLOG

This file captures AI agent interactions, decisions, discoveries, and work performed on the TNH Scholar project. It provides historical context for continuity across sessions and helps human collaborators understand the evolution of the codebase.

See AGENTLOG_TEMPLATE.md for structure and format.

**Archive**: Older sessions are archived in [`archive/agentlogs/`](archive/agentlogs/) with a summary index at [`archive/agentlogs/archive-index.md`](archive/agentlogs/archive-index.md).

**Ordering**: Append new records at the end (chronological order from least to most recent).
