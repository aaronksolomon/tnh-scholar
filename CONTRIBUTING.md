## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you find any issues or bugs, please report them in the **Issues** section of the repository. Make sure to include:
  - A clear description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Any relevant logs or screenshots.
  
### 2. Suggesting Features
We welcome new ideas and suggestions! If you have a feature in mind that would improve the project, please open an **Issue** labeled as a "Feature Request". Provide as much detail as possible about the feature, its potential benefits, and any possible implementation details.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests
Before submitting a pull request:
  - Make sure your changes align with the project goals.
  - If you're introducing significant changes, please discuss them with the maintainers by opening an issue first.
  
To submit a pull request:
  1. Fork the repository.
  2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
  3. Make your changes and add tests if applicable.
  4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
  5. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature-branch`).
  6. Open a pull request in the main repository.
  
### 4. Coding Standards
Please follow these general guidelines for contributing to the code:
  - Follow Python PEP8 standards for formatting.
  - Include clear and concise comments, especially for complex sections of code.
  - Ensure that all new features or changes are covered by appropriate tests.
  - Update documentation if your changes affect it (e.g., adding new models, changing the workflow).

### 5. Setting Up the Development Environment
To set up a local copy of the project:
  1. Fork and clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  3. Run any tests to ensure everything is working (`pytest` or other test frameworks in use).

### 6. Tests
Make sure your changes are covered by tests. If you're adding a new feature, write tests that cover both typical and edge cases. If you're fixing a bug, add a test to ensure that the bug won't reoccur.
