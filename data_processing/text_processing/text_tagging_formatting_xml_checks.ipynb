      "A tone poem, a snatch of gentle, celebratory  music. A verse about death, which is really about life. A transmutation of death; the emptying of the veins of death, the letting in of light and air to those fearful spaces. How does one cope with death, when death strikes, repeatedly, senselessly, destroying the young, the noble, the brave, the self giving?  Grief  of course,  a period  of silence,  space  for mourning. Then afterward, a reassertion, acceptance. And finally, if one is lucky, endowed, perceptive, brave with the bravery of an artist and poet, he creates something that faces the cruelty, the horror, and he brings to that welter of blood, vengeance, cruelty, and deceit, a \"sea change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one of the classic and very nearly crushing ironies of the long war in Vietnam; that we have been the recipient, time and again, of gifts of the spirit, gifts of art, profound understanding, hope communicated,  a definition of our selves that exceeds by far our expectation of ourselves. We have heard time and again, from the \"enemy,\" a stubborn distinction between ourselves as a people, and our leadership. Our people have been endowed (by presumption of the same \"enemy\") with compassion, political acuity, generosity, and goodness of spirit. We were a people saddled for a time with an unfortunate and cruel leadership, which persisted in bloodletting despite the best instinct of the majority. Thus went the reading of our character by our \"enemy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such definitions have a mysterious power of creating what they signify, in a sense at least analogous to the sacramental. One thinks of such \"opinions\" so stubbornly held, so patiently reiterated over so long a period of violence, across such unexampled savagery, perpetuated  by a whole succession of American leaders-one thinks of this, and is simultaneously appalled, exhilarated,  and given hope. Is it possible that out of a persecuted, defamed, all but destroyed people should arise the Suffering Servant of our own oracles; possible that salvation for the heinous, blood-ridden West should once again come from the East-and this, not in times of social normalcy, but across the curtain of blood that we wove and suspended between that people and ourselves, upon which they were stretched and racked, day after day, the people to whom Pascal surely had reference, those \"crucified until the end of time\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "In a universal catastrophe, it is surely presumptuous  to single out one element, one tradition, as having \"suffered more\" than others. Who can measure such things? They stop the heart in its tracks. At the same time, the religious resistance in the U.S. at the time of the Vietnam  War could not help but take into special account, with a special gratitude, the Vietnamese Buddhist movement. Spiritually speaking, we were closest to them. We drew most fully on their tradition-such a stubborn, unwavering, gentle, persistent, resilient strength! It seems to me far from stretching a point (more likely simply making a point) to see in this Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, and his people, a literal living out of the words of Paul the apostle, writing  to his community, \"... fatiguing labors more abundant, imprisonments  more frequent, lashings innumerable, many threats of death  ... forty  lashes less one ... three  times scourged, once I was stoned,  three times I suffered ship wreck; a night and a day I was adrift on the high seas; in frequent  journey on foot, in perils from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles,  in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder ness, in perils on the sea, in perils from false brethren,  in fatigue and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in fastings, often in cold and nakedness.... And apart from these things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, my solicitude for all our communities!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This monk, this suffering servant, who is also a poet, an activist, a teacher, and scholar, suffered a personal loss of the most appalling nature. Young Buddhists were studying at the School of Youth for Social Service, which Nhat Hanh had founded in Saigon early in the '60s. There the students were imbued with the spirit of nonviolent service. On leaving the school, they were to go in groups to help the peasants of the South in whatever way possible-building homes, sowing or harvesting crops, resettling refugees, simple, concrete  projects (we would even say, strikingly evangelical ones). But such a school, in such a time, be came a mortal threat to some of those for whom weapons were the indispensable means of survival or liberation. A period of terrorism  was quickly launched. Students  were killed and maimed in a series of bombings. Finally, one night a horrendous crime unfolded. Five of the students were seized in their dormitories, led to the riverbank nearby and shot. One survived, the others died immediately. \n",
      "\n",
      "The episode was not widely reported in the world. It was merely another bloody stereotyped incident of war, a spurt of gunfire in the night, a cry, blood quickly shed, quickly erased.  But not  forgotten by a monk who was also the friend of the slain. And so after a time, after grief and loss had had their time, came this gift, this meditation of Nhat Hanh, peaceful and serious, theologically profound, hopeful, light, airy of spirit, a paschal death and victory, a pas sage by water from time to timelessness. Written, one may rightfully presume,  by one whose soul already  is com pounded  of these qualities,  since he conveys them with such skill. Indeed, to him the dead are the quick, and violence is by no means the master, by no means speaks the last word, or stops the mouth of the victim, or indeed finally rules, whatever his boast, his bloodstained  and inflated pretentious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ironies implicit in the play are enormous and far of reach. We Americans cross the great waters with our techniques of death, supersonic instruments  of appetite, great eyes and ears and maws, a deranged and decapitated sensory apparatus, to smell out and destroy the least lurking evidence of life, health, hope, tradition, faith, family, to tear out the very taproot of existence, to plow up and sow with salt that culture, thousands of years old, which has unfailingly nurtured  a people. \"Let it come down! Let it all come down!\" is the manic whine of the Machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo, coming  across  those same waters (which  we name consciousness, Styx, death, or primordial creation) comes another sort of craft, peopled with spirits, listening, bantering, remembering, laughing. Their wounds  are healed, their memories lucid. They  recall without rancor the method and moment of their death. If there is some thing new about them, it is a quality at once elusive, feisty, a way of standing within death, fronting it, mocking it gently; perhaps best of all, forgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "These  spirits are as they were before death. And this is the genius of Thich  Nhat Hanh. His dead have the verisimilitude of the living. They are young, they push shadows back instead  of joining them. They  push the dark back, they create  space, they speak up. Very different indeed from the dimwit ghosts of Virgil's underworld;  more like the robustness,  the crudity, of Dante's  people-those  in hell, chiefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet with a difference, which continues to escape my mind. It has something to do with a work of authentic Buddhist art, by a monk, about his people. A quality of inwardness, almost of austerity; a patience that escapes our monitors and timepieces; a serenity, caricatured cruelly in the West as stoicism, before death. Something of the twice born, the resurrected, something one sees more and more rarely in the West; now and again in the faces of the old, in a few children, in the cruel ecstasy of street  violence; a light within, struck and then out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only  here it is a steady flame. It lights  those  bodies, making lamps of them, as they cross the waters in our direction. They  come toward us, and their speech is all of forgiveness, of hope, and joy. Indeed, the play seemed to me a simple act of forgiveness and reconciliation. Are you saying to us, Nhat Hanh,  that the Vietnamese  dead will come back to us who murdered  them? will come, not as ministers of vengeance, but sacramental presences, angels, spirits of new creation?  \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so, with all my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I thank you, Nhat Hanh, monk, medium, necromancer, artist. For your grief, for your long travail, your exile, for the deaf and dumb and uncaring world, for the crucifixion and death of your people. Forgive us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because the monk Thomas  Merton  said it to you, and your play says it to me, I dare to repeat: Alleluia! We shall see his face!\n",

      "At 12:30 a.m. on July 5, 1967, in the village of Binh Phuoc, Gia Dinh Province, a group of strangers abducted five young men, brought  them to the bank of the Saigon River, and shot them. All five were volunteer  workers in the School of Youth for Social Service, a nonviolent organization that sought only to heal the wounds of war and reconstruct  the villages. Their names were Tuan, Tho,  Hy, Lanh, and Dinh. Tuan was a Buddhist novice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four died immediately. The fifth, Dinh, survived, but his clothes were soaked with blood and he lost consciousness. The strangers thought all five were dead, so they left.  Silence on the river. There  are many stars in the sky, but no moon. A small sampan comes gently to the shore. Mai appears. The sampan is large enough to take the four, only four, because the fifth, Dinh, is still alive, and must stay be hind.\n",

      "\n",
      "True or not, we will never know. But if the author  has guaranteed  it, then let us believe him. Listen  to what he has said: \"I remember  when I first picked up my pen to write this play.

Is there a river that separates the two sides, a river that no boat can cross? Is such complete separation  possible? Please come over to my boat. I will show you that there is a river, but there is no separation. Don't hesitate: I will row the boat myself. You can join me in rowing too, but let us row slowly, and very, very quietly.\"\n",

      "MAI: Well, at last we hear from you, Lanh. You've been so quiet. Yes, you are right. The saying \"Yin and Yang are irrevocably separate\" is misleading. A lot of the sorrow that plagues the living comes from their belief that the two worlds are unbridgeable. Indeed, you can sing for the living, as I have many times... as Hy just did. \n",

      "HY: When we were alive, art was with us. Now, art is still with us. Perhaps we are still alive, in some way. While we were living, we were already dying. How could we have life without death, or, for that matter, death without life?\n",

The living always tell stories about people who die unjustified deaths. They  talk about the revenge of the dead, and they become deathly afraid.

      "HY: It was about midnight. Tuan, Lanh, and I were asleep at the Health  Aid Post when a group  of armed  men arrived. They tied our arms behind us and set the Post on fire. The flames made it look as bright as day. Then they took us to the lake near the Tinh Vo Gymnasium and told us to wait. A moment later, two more men arrived with Dinh and Tho. Their arms were also tied behind their backs. Then they took all five of us to the riverbank. We were next to the bamboo grove, supposedly waiting for a boat. Again and again they asked if we were part of the Youth for Social Service, to be absolutely sure. Then, suddenly, they shot us. We four died, but Dinh was only wounded. They thought he was dead too, so they left.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: There were eleven of them. Some were very young, sixteen or seventeen. The  oldest must have been under thirty. Some of them wore black clothes, some wore uni forms. One had a raincoat  and another  a poncho. Some wore military caps and bullet belts. I know who they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: I know who they were, too. You don't have to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: I had the feeling  they were not experienced at the business of killing. They  had to kill us, but I could feel their reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: They obviously had orders from someone. The leader of the group, the one who shot me in the head twice, looked as though  he had to convince himself to pull the trigger. He just didn't have it in him to do it easily. When they arrived at the house of the village medical chief, they immediately tied us together  so we couldn't  run. On the way to the river, we had to jump over two ditches about a meter  wide, and at the second one, Dinh  fell and they helped him up. I asked if they would cut us loose from each other so we could walk more easily, and they did. While we were walking, they talked to us in a very friendly way.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: The men who abducted the three of us behaved the same way. They were very gentle. They let us stop and rest a couple of times. I really thought it wouldn't be too bad. When  Tho  crawled under  barbed wire and cut himself, one man touched  his forehead and asked about  it, as a brother would. Another even patted me on the shoulder.\n",

      "LANH: They  asked us if we were part of the School  of Youth for Social Service. Then they walked a little ways away and whispered  to each other.  After  that  they approached us again and asked the same question, and then they consulted each other again in whispers. They repeat ed this a few more times, then they asked us, \"Do you have anything to say?\" When  I heard  that,  chills ran up my spine. Tho said we had nothing to say, and the leader touched his forehead and said, very quickly, \"I have to kill you.\" Then  he put his gun to Tho's temple, and fired two shots. The rest of us were shot right after. Hy fell into the river, and was shot until he sank.\n",

In order to grow, Tho had to receive support from many other forms of existence-air for his lungs, food for his body, education  for his mind, love for his heart. In Tho,  there are innumerable physical and mental beings-his father and mother, myself, and that girl with ruddy cheeks who will cry this morning over his departure.

      "HY: Brother Tuan, are you speaking about wrong perceptions? Hatred  and fear blind us. We no longer see each other. We see only the faces of monsters, and that gives us the courage to destroy each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: The  war that is raging in our homeland is caused by exactly this blindness. Those who are shooting at this very moment  do not know who they are fighting. All are victims. And some are ready to profit from the mutual destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: That is certainly true of those who killed us. In a fleeting moment, I think they saw that we were just human beings, not monsters. But, when the moment arrived, they\n",
      "\n",
      "had to shoot, to obey orders. It must be the cruel, irrevocable order imposed on man's destiny. \n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Oh, Lanh, you talk as if there were such a thing as an abstract  order. That order came from their superiors,  who else?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: You do not  understand, Tho. The ones who killed you were only obeying  the orders  of their superiors. And those superiors  were also victims. Yet, those who shot you did show their human qualities. They hesitated,  not wanting to kill you, fighting against  themselves. They had to carry out their orders  because they were crushed  between the hammer and the anvil, the orders  and their  families, their  jobs, even their lives. Their consciences  and perceptions had been greatly obscured.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: One man even exclaimed, \"God, you are all so young!\" It was not  just an expression of pity for us, but also a pro test against his own fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Men kill because, on the one hand, they do not know their  real enemy, and on the other  hand,  they are pushed into a position  where they must kill. Let me tell you what happened  to our Brother  Duc last year. He was waiting for a civilian plane at a small isolated airport  in the highlands, along with a young American army officer who was waiting for a caribou plane to fly him on a search-and-destroy operation. There was no one else besides  the two of them. The young American struck up a conversation  with Brother Duc, who immediately saw that the man knew nothing about Vietnamese history or culture or the  truth of the conflict in which he was playing a part. He knew only one thing: the Vietcong were his enemy. His duty, as he put it, was to destroy the Vietcong in order  to save the Vietnamese and the free world. Brother  Duc felt so sad. He asked the GI, \"Are you afraid of Vietcong?\" With  that question the soldier leaped to his feet. Duc saw the alarm and suspi cion in his eyes, fear that Duc himself might be a VC. The GI had been told again and again that the VC were very cunning, and wherever he went, he imagined that the VC were present. So he asked rapidly, putting his hands on his gun, \"Are you a VC?\" Brother Duc thought  the question was funny, but he dared not smile. He knew that if he said, in a joking spirit, \"Yes,\" the soldier would shoot him. So he answered, \"No,\" and explained that he was only a professor of religion waiting to catch a plane back to Saigon. Do you know what our Brother Duc said after he had told us about this incident?  He said that if he had been killed then, it would not have been because the American soldier wanted to kill him. The  soldier only wanted to kill Vietcong. He could hate the VC only because he did not really know what the VC were. He imagined that they were wild, cruel monsters that had to be hunted down. In his country the people are fed so much of this that they keep letting their government send men over here to kill and be killed. So, men kill unjustly and in turn are killed unjustly, and it is their own countrymen  who kill them. They  are the ones responsible for the massacre of our people, but they think they have nothing to do with it because it is not they who hold the guns and pull the triggers. Who is really killing us? It is fear, hatred, and prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: The world of the living is shrouded in fog. All I feel now is compassion for the destiny of mankind. It is like walking in a moonless, starless night.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Excuse me, but may I change the subject? You know, one of the reasons I am taking you to see Sister Lien is that I want you to see her paintings. I believe that she has really achieved something. In her earthly life she loved art very much, but now she has realized it. I am sure she draws inspiration from the <i>Heart Sutra.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Vui, too, used to love art when she was alive. I suppose they are in accord now. I love painting  myself. Do you think I will understand Sister  Lien's work? Inspiration drawn from the <i>Heart Sutra, </i>that's awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: What wouldn't you be able to understand, Hy? Just a while ago we discussed the <i>Prajñaparamita </i>itself! We each paint our own lives.  If your work is broad and free your life will be broad and free, also. That  is all. We create our own worlds with our visions, conceptions, and thoughts. We might create a constricted world of suffering and sorrow, or one that is immense  and free, a truly  beautiful place. The essential ingredient is a spirit of openness, tolerance, and freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Now I understand what Brother Tuan meant when he said, \"The mind is like a painter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI <i>(laughs): </i>Yes. Why don't you all begin here and now to paint your own lives. Every artist is capable, through  his art, of reaching the supreme objective of life itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tho: Then my picture, Sister Mai, will probably look like that of Vui. My world must contain a lemon tree! I once threatened Brother Duc  that  if the Pure  Land  has no lemon trees I will refuse to enter! But that's not all. My world will also have coconut trees, moats where the water is clear in the morning,  thatch-roofed schools where at noontime  the children's singing reaches my ears: \"Lam Son Mountains! Lam Son Mountains! Banners flapping in the wind!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Tho, do be quiet!I didn't realize that the dead could be homesick! When  little Thanh of Binh Phuoc Hamlet hears that his teacher has been killed, he will cry until he has no tears left. Yes, our Pure Land must contain those little boys, and friendly meetings in the village where the first event of the program is always, \"Our  headman has a few words to say to you.\" There  must also be those wharfs down by the river where we bathe, where we can swim over to the other side and snatch a few ears of com to roast on an open fire and eat together. It is such a small world, isn't it, Sister Mai?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI  <i>(smiles tolerantly): </i>No, Lanh, it is not a small world. The  strokes of your painting are those of love. Not only scenes of mountains or clouds or immense skies are breath taking. Lonely pines standing on snowy cliffs can also be free and bold. The world of the bodhisattvas also has lakes and ponds, low hills, curved bridges, and red earthen paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH  <i>(mysteriously): </i>And highways.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Yes, and highways. Because of love, you draw lemon trees,  fig trees,  bamboo  groves, and river wharfs. The longer the war lasts, the more hatred it creates, and love is being crushed underfoot. We see those dear to us unjustly destroyed and it is hard to keep our hearts peaceful so that love can survive. Using hatred to fight hatred is the surest way to create even more hatred. Those who create love are fewer and fewer, while those who create hate are more and more. And we are changed by it all. Simple, honest, close to-the-earth people, even after the war is over, will go on bearing the deep wounds inflicted by all this hatred. \n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Isn't that the biggest concern? It must be better to be destroyed in a split second and then recreated, than to destroy all faith and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: Yes, Lanh, that is our basic concern. I, myself, was born in 1945, the year of the revolution. The last of our family's three boys. As we grew up, all we saw was war and hatred. My hometown, Ben Tre, was where the energy and fervor of the revolution were in constant movement, much like the swift, deep water of the Tien  Giang River on its way to the sea. Fortunately, my family realized early on the necessity of love and encouraged me to follow my inclina tion for a monk's life. I went to the Buddhist Institutes of Giac Sanh, Tra Vinh, and later An Quang. Then I took up social studies and fieldwork. When  I worked hard, it was not because I had any illusion about my ability to change the situation. That  would have been like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a cup of water. But I did have faith then, and I still have faith now, that our work was of value because it sowed seeds of tolerance  and love in people's hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Let us hope that our earthly  lives, as well as our deaths, have sown the seeds of tolerance and love. Sister Mai's death, for instance, did not provoke any hatred. On the contrary, it awakened in many people the ability to un derstand and sacrifice, even people far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: We are approaching the  source  of the  river, my brothers. Have you noticed how thick the forest is getting?\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: The  boat has been going fast, Sister Mai. Is Vui's village near the frontier? \n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Yes. In twenty kilometers, we will leave the boat for the jungle. The  current will be so strong  that it will be impossible for us to continue  to row upstream.\n",

      "<i>(Monkeys' cries echo through  the forest)</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Dawn is almost here, friends. Brother Tuan, look up at the great trees, pink in the light of dawn! There is someone standing  there waiting, isn't there? Could it be Lien?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI <i>(smiles): </i>Of course it's Lien. \"Who else? Let's row a bit harder, come on, let's row.\n",

      "\n",
      "The essence of nonviolence is love. Out of love and the willingness to act selflessly, strategies,  tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise naturally. Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process. Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance, but a non violent one cannot  use such blind sources of energy, for they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself. Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and '70s arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside,  and people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people's survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and maintain the strictest  neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as \"pro-communist  neutralists.\" Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North  Vietnamese spoke for the communist  bloc and the South  Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist  bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a \"victory\" by either side.  During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children raising  their  bare hands against barbed  wire; students confronting military  police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and holding bayonets; young women running  through  clouds of tear gas with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently; monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for independence from the French,  and they won the support  of their countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive resistance and undertake  positive efforts to over come the war and the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue  and Danang learned  that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those cities brought  their family altars-the most sacred objects in their homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition  to oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying they used religion for political  purposes,  but I do not agree. They  were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront  the violence. This was not a political act; it was an act of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fasting, the method used most by Mahatma Gandhi to help India in its struggle for independence,  was also used in Vietnam. Sometimes,  thousands of people fasted, and other times, a single person fasted. We fasted as prayer to purify our hearts, consolidate our will, and arouse awareness and compassion in others. When Thich Tri Quang fasted for 100 days, those who passed the Duy Tan Clinic were jarred into awareness, and compassion was born in them. As a result, they felt compelled  to meet, talk, and plan, thereby escalating the struggle. Thich Tri Quang had not <i>planned </i>to fast. He <i>had </i>to fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also used literature and the arts as \"weapons\" to challenge the oppression. Works by antiwar writers, composers, poets, and artists, although illegal, were widely circulated. Antiwar songs were sung in streets and classrooms, and antiwar literature became the largest category of books sold in Vietnam, even infiltrating army units. <i>Look Back at Your Homeland, Only Death Allows You to Speak Out, </i>and <i>Lotus in a Sea of Fire </i>sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Our literature was considered  dangerous  by both sides. One book of poems, <i>Let Us Pray so the White Dove Will Be with Us, </i>was submitted to the Ministry of Information, and only two of the sixty poems in it were approved. A group of students published it anyway, and within a week, all copies were sold. In Hue, a policeman saw a copy in a bookstore and warned the owner, \"Hide  this and only bring it out when someone asks for it.\" Sister Cao Ngoc Phuong was arrested  in Hue for transporting antiwar books, and, before I left the country, I was also arrested and imprisoned for a few days in Bao Loc for \"antiwar\" activities, although I was charged only with the crime of listening  to Hanoi Radio.  Folk poetry was used as means of education. This lullaby was sung throughout the country:\n",

      "During the superpower confrontation in Vietnam, while thousands and thousands of peasants  and children lost their lives, our land was unmercifully ravaged. Yet we were unable to stop the fighting; we were not able to make ourselves heard or understood. We had little access to the international news media. People thought we Buddhists were trying to seize power, but we had no interest in power. We only wanted to stop the slaughter. The voice of the Viet namese people-8O percent  Buddhists-was lost in the melee of shooting and bombs. But we realized  that the means and the end are one, and we never employed any kind of action  that  betrayed  our commitment to nonviolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1963, Venerable Thich Quang Duc went to the cross\n",
      "\n",
      "roads of Phan  Dinh  Phung,  sat in the  lotus  position, poured gasoline on himself, and transformed himself into a torch. His disciple read his last words to the press. Madame Nhu described it as a \"barbecue.\" By burning himself, Thich  Quang Duc awakened the world to the suffering of the war and the persecution of the Buddhists. When someone stands up to violence in such a courageous way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc's act expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way, including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be \"a torch in the dark night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She left behind letters to the Presidents  of North  and South Vietnam, imploring  them to stop the fighting.  She wrote one letter to me: \"Thay, don't worry too much. We will have peace soon.\" Nhat Chi Mai moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the hearts of the oppressors and call the world's attention  to the suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination,  courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots on his body with <i>moxa </i>incense as he takes the 2<i>50 </i>vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to helping living beings. If he were to say this while sitting comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered  while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing  this kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Vietnamese   monks,  nuns,  and  laypeople  who burned themselves were saying with all their strength and determination that they were willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy,  but to create.  Suicide  is an act of self-destruction based on the inability to cope with life's difficulties. In Buddhism, self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions  of the precepts. Those  who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance,  fanaticism, oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that  lay within the hearts of their fellow men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself. Then  everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence. Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors and students followed suit. There  were labor strikes at the harbors and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and university students  boycotted  classes and examinations. Draftees refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals. The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas, grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these nonviolent efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement, damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned  or killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians, workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously wounded-all  because they refused to take sides in the war. In a memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and neutrality: \"Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways of working for the people of Vietnam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite  the  results-many years of war followed  by years of oppression and human rights abuse-1 cannot say that our struggle was a failure. The conditions for success in terms of a political victory were not present. But the success of a nonviolent struggle can be measured only in terms of the love and nonviolence attained, not whether a political victory was achieved. In our struggle in Vietnam, we did our best to remain true to our principles. We never lost sight that the essence of our struggle was love itself, and that was a real contribution to humanity.\n",

      "A Proposal for Peace\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>This statement was read at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on June 1, 1966, and reprinted in the Congressional Record the next day.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "Just this morning, the U.S. Consulate in Hue was destroyed by angry Vietnamese youths. In the past four days, five Vietnamese have immolated themselves, some of them leaving behind messages explaining that their actions were in protest against U.S. policy in South Vietnam. During my short visit to your country,  I have repeatedly been asked why the Vietnamese people seem to have become so strongly anti-American.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish, first  of all, to assure you that  I am not  anti American. Indeed, it is precisely because I do have a great respect and admiration for America that I have undertaken this long voyage to your country,  a voyage that entails great personal risk for me upon my return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this risk willingly because I have faith that if the American public can begin to understand some thing of what the Vietnamese  people feel about what is happening in our country, much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery being endured by both our peoples might be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demonstrations, self-immolations, and protests that we are witnessing in Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frustrations that the Vietnamese people feel at being so effectively excluded from participation in the determination of their country's future. Eighty years of French domination over Vietnam were ended by a long and bloody struggle waged and won by the Vietnamese people against overwhelming odds. During the twelve years since independence, most Vietnamese have remained without a voice in the nation's destiny, and this at a time when the nation is being subjected to a destructive force far surpassing anything ever before seen in our country. If anti-Americanism seems to be emerging  as a focus for some of the recent protests,  it is because the Vietnamese people recognize that it is really only the awesome U.S. power that enables the Saigon governments to rule without a popular mandate and to follow policies contrary  to the aspirations of the Vietnamese  people. This  is not  the independence for which the Vietnamese people fought so valiantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war in Vietnam today pits brother against brother, the Vietcong against the supporters of the Saigon government. Both sides claim to represent the Vietnamese people, but in reality neither  side does. The  most effective Vietcong propaganda says that the Saigon governments are mere puppets of the U.S., corrupt lackeys of the imperialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every escalation  of the war, every new contingent of U.S. troops confirms these charges and wins new recruits to the Vietcong,  for the overwhelming  majority  of the Vietnamese people now thirst desperately for peace and oppose any further expansion of the war. They see clearly that the present  policy of constant  escalation only puts peace ever further into the future and merely guarantees an even greater destruction of Vietnamese society. There  are now more than 300,000 Americans in my country, most of them knowing and caring little about our customs and practices and many of them involved in destroying Vietnamese people and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "This  creates friction  which generously  feeds the anti American propaganda,  and the fact that the war kills far more innocent  peasants than it does Vietcong is a tragic reality of life in the Vietnamese countryside. Those  who escape death by bombings must often abandon  their destroyed villages and seek shelter  in refugee camps where life is even more miserable than it was in the villages. In general, these people do not blame the Vietcong for their plight. It is the men in the planes, who drop death and destruction  from the skies, who appear to them to be their enemies. How can they see it otherwise?\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States chooses to support those elements in Vietnam that appear to be most devoted to the U.S.'s wishes for Vietnam's future. But these elements have never been viewed by the Vietnamese people as their spokesmen. Diem was not, nor were Diem's successors. Thus,  it has been the U.S.'s antipathy to popular government in South Vietnam, together  with its hope for an ultimate  military solution, that has not only contradicted the deepest aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but actually undermined the very objective for which we believe Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "To us, America's first objective is to have an anticommunist, or at least a non-communist, Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese people's objective is to have peace. They dislike communism, but they dislike war even more, especially after twenty years of fighting and bitterness which has rotted the very fabric of Vietnamese life. Equally important, we now see clearly that continuance of the war is more likely to spread communism in Vietnam than to contain it. The new social class of military officers and <i>commerfants </i>that has been created as a direct result of the U.S. involvement, a class of sycophants who support the war for crass economic reasons, are not the people to whom Washington should listen if it sincerely wishes to hear the voice of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people reject with scorn this corrupt  and self-seeking class that cares neither  for Vietnam nor for the great ideals of America, but thinks only of its own interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opinion is often expressed that there is no alternative to the present U.S. policy in Vietnam, neither on the political nor the military side. The non-communist alternatives to a military dictatorship  are said to be too fragmented  to offer a stable alternative, and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal  are considered  unfeasible  because it is feared that the Vietcong will take over the country by terror.\n",

      "The Vietnamese people recognize both of these dangers, but they also recognize  the utter  futility  of the present course and the catastrophic effects that it is having on our society. Furthermore, we do not agree that there is no alternative to a military dictatorship. The force of Vietnamese nationalism is such an alternative. Indeed, this is the sole force that can prevent the complete disintegration  of South Vietnam, and it is the force around which all Vietnamese can unite. But nationalism cannot attain its effective potential in the present Vietnamese political climate, where opposition to the government invites open persecution upon oneself and identification with it discredits one in the eyes of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "More  than a decade of this atmosphere has served to drive many of the Vietnamese nationalists into the National Liberation Front, and many others of them into an ominous silence. Last year, an effort by a prominent group of nationalists  to circulate a mild petition  requesting  peace negotiations  between the South Vietnamese government and the NLF was so brutally attacked by the government that we are not likely to hear from them soon again, de spite their having attained some 5,000 signers in less than three days' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the means for nationalist expression rests mainly with the Vietnamese Buddhists, who alone command sufficient popular support  to spearhead a protest for popular government. This  is not a new role for Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the Vietnamese  peasants, Buddhism and nationalism are inseparably entwined. The historic accident that made the popularization of Christianity in Vietnam coincident with France subjugation of Vietnam created this image.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repression of our faith by the French and by President Diem strengthened it. And today, when the Buddhist attempt  to give expression to the long pent-up wishes of the submerged and ignored Vietnamese masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the Vietnamese army, the Vietnamese people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly see whose action reflects our national heritage and whose action betrays this heritage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, although  the Vietnamese  people may lose skirmishes because they have no foreign sources of support, the crude victories of the Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their credibility while confirming the Vietcong's propaganda claim that the government cares nothing about the people. The Buddhist efforts are designed not to weaken Vietnam's resistance but to create a genuine will to resist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differences do exist among the Buddhists, the Catholics, and the other sects, but they would not be insurmountable if there were a climate in Vietnam that encouraged unity. But there are those who see a unified, popular, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a threat to themselves. Such persons help to sow disunity and then use the disunity which they create as a pretext for retaining power. No, we do not accept the evaluation  that there is no alternative to the present type of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second argument offered for continuing the present U.S. policy is that a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal would merely leave Vietnam to the communists. This argument we must also reject. The Vietcong grow stronger  because of the mistakes made by Saigon, not because of its communist ideology or its terror. If South Vietnam could achieve a government clearly responsive to the basic aspirations of the Vietnamese people and truly independent, there would no longer be any basis for popular support for the rebels. Indeed,  the rebels would have lost their reason to rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to continue, the Vietnamese people would have the will to resist it, for they could identify it as being hostile to Vietnamese nationalism, contrary to the people's longing for peace and reconstruction, and therefore of foreign inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam. Although  I am not a politician  and cannot therefore suggest every detail of a satisfactory settlement, the general direction that such a solution must take is quite clear to me and to many of the Vietnamese people. It does not involve the U.S. in any negotiations  with Hanoi, Peking, or the NLF. To the Vietnamese people, such talks, if necessary, are the proper province of Vietnamese officials rather than of Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "My solution would be along the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>1. A cessation of the bombing, north and south.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>2. Limitation of all military operations by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces to defensive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Vietcong respond in kind.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal actually beginning to take place as a sign of sin cerity.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>4. A clear statement  by the U.S. of its desire to help the Vietnamese  people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to implement  this statement, such as a refusal to support one group over another.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>5. A generous effort to help rebuild, in light of the destruction that has been wreaked upon Vietnam, such aid to be completely free of ideological and political strings and therefore not viewed as an affront to Vietnamese independence.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a program, if implemented with sufficient vigor to convince  the now understandably skeptical Vietnamese people of its sincerity, offers the best hope for uniting them in a constructive effort and for restoring stability to South Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is not perfect, for the question remains of how the U.S. can be sure that the South Vietnamese government and the Vietcong would cooperate in such a venture. Insofar as the South Vietnamese government is concerned, the past statements  of Premier  Ky have clearly indicated his unwillingness to seek a peaceful end to the war. In fact, it has been the contradiction between the aggressive words of Saigon and the peaceful statements of Washington that has so discredited the so-called U.S. peace offensive of last winter. The  withdrawal of the U.S. support  for Ky may thus be a necessary precondition for implementation of such a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is obviously not possible to predict the response of the Vietcong to such a program, but the installation of a popular government in South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the beginning of an American withdrawal, would so undercut the Vietcong's position that it is likely to have no alternative but to cooperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace. To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns. America's history suggests that she has the potential  to provide the world this leadership.\n",

      "\n",
      "In Vietnam, we take great risks publishing antiwar poems. Buddhists who have protested the war have been arrested and exiled, and are now being killed in Danang. Because of this great risk, the Buddhists who demonstrated this Spring were reluctant to advocate openly an end to the war through negotiations; instead, they called for elections and democracy. We are in an impossible dilemma. If we openly call for peace, we are identified with the communists and the government will try to suppress us. If we criticize the communists, we find ourselves aligned with those Vietnamese who have been propagandists  for the Americans for years and whose words against communism are soiled and discredited because they have been paid to say them. To be honorably anticommunist has been to remain silent, and, being silent, we have been labeled as innocent of the dangers of communism. But we are not. We are well aware of the restrictions on Buddhism in the North. We have studied  what happened  in China.  We know there  is no place for spirituality in Marxism. We are ready to under take a peaceful political struggle with the communists, if only the destruction of the war can be stopped. We are confident  that the South .Vietnamese can protect  themselves from communist  domination  if we are allowed to carry out our political lives in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  tragedy of American policy is that it has made such a peaceful political struggle very difficult. The Americans could have helped in reconstructing the country peacefully if they had cooperated with and strengthened the Buddhists and others who had the respect of the people. Instead, they have tried to divide the Buddhists to prevent them from becoming an organized force, and this has been disastrous. Catholicism came to Vietnam with the French, and the Catholic leaders, backed by the U.S., were objects of suspicion for most of the people. The Buddhist tradition is closely linked with nationalism, and it is unthinkable to the broad mass of people that the Buddhists would betray them to a foreign  power. At the same time, Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic in character-there are Catholic priests who are closer to us on the question of peace than some of the older, more conservative Buddhist priests. (A few months  ago, eleven Catholic  priests issued a strong statement calling for peace, and they were attacked by the Catholic leaders.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the U.S. has become too afraid of the communists to allow a peaceful confrontation with them to take place, and when you are afraid, you cannot win. Sending 300,000\n",
      "\n",
      "American troops to Vietnam and bombing the countryside have only caused the communists to grow stronger. American military operations have killed and wounded more innocent peasants than Vietcong, and the Americans are blamed and hated for this. The peasants are not violently antagonistic to the Vietcong. The strong anticommunists are mostly people in the cities who fear the loss of their property, cars, businesses, and homes, and rely on the foreign army to protect them. The American soldiers, moreover, do not understand the Vietnamese. GIs make thousands of small mistakes every day that offend Vietnamese people. And the continual roaring overhead of U.S. planes on their way to drop bombs makes the people sick and angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it is understandable that the villagers distrust those who are connected with the South Vietnamese government and the Americans. Along with others, I helped organize a Buddhist School of Youth for Social Service, and we have trained thousands of young people to work at community development projects in the villages. We refuse to accept money from the government or the American Military Assistance Group. We go into the villages with nothing but our own robes, and we are warmly welcomed. The  peasants we work with tell us that the government officials assigned to \"assist\" them keep thousands of piasters a month for themselves and do nothing for them. They have come to dislike the Vietcong and fear the Americans, whose bombs continue to fall down on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the U.S. wants to escalate the war, we Vietnamese cannot stop you. Even changes of government will make no difference. The war will go on. Venerable Thich Tri Quang believes we may attain peace indirectly by means of political maneuvering and through elections. He is a man of action, courage, and intelligence, whose life is exemplary. But other Buddhists are trying to create a new Buddhist path emphasizing ways of helping the people who live on the land. I myself doubt that much will be gained by indirect political maneuvering against the government and the Catholics, as long as the U.S. is determined to continue the war. Underlying  our struggles with the government  in Danang and other cities is the unstated question of whether the war will go on, and this only the U.S. can decide. I believe the most effective thing we can do is advocate peace, however dangerous that may be, by telling the world that we do not accept this war, that the communists are growing stronger every day it continues to be fought,  and that a cease-fire  must be arranged  with the Vietcong as soon as possible. Then we would welcome the help of Americans in the peaceful reconstruction of our country. Only America has the capability of stopping this war, which is destroying not only our lives, but our culture and everything of human value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  poems that follow are not typical of my own poetry or of Vietnamese poetry generally. The tradition of poetry in Vietnam is very old and complex. It draws on early Chinese poetry, on the French Romantic and symbolist poets of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and, in my own case, on Zen Buddhist writers. Much of my poetry could be called \"philosophical,\" and friends  have found  it in some ways similar to the work of Tagore; at least, it is extremely difficult to translate into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these poems are different. They are popular poems\n",
      "\n",
      "in free verse, and when I write them I am trying to speak very simply for the majority of Vietnamese, who are peas ants and cannot speak for themselves. They do not know or care much about words like \"communism\" or \"democracy,\" but only want the war to end so they can survive. I wrote these poems first for myself; when I read them I can regain the state of intense  feeling in which I composed them. They have now been read and heard by many Vietnamese;  and they have been denounced by both  sides fighting in the war. A few days after they were published last year, government police came to seize them from the bookstores, but by then they had all been sold. They were attacked by the Hanoi radio and the radio of the National Liberation Front. They have been read many times in public along with the peace poems of other  Buddhists, and they have been sung with guitar accompaniment at student meetings, much as songs of protest are sung in the United States.\n",

      "Ahimsa: The Path of Harmlessness\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sanskrit word <i>ahimsa, </i>usually translated  \"nonviolence,\" literally means \"non-harming\" or \"harmlessness.\" To practice ahimsa, first of all we have to practice it within ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going in the direction  of non violence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even soldiers. Some army generals, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid killing innocent people; this is a kind of nonviolence. To help soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with them. If we divide reality into two camps-the violent and the nonviolent-and stand in one camp while attacking  the other,  the world will never have peace. We will always blame and condemn those we feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without recognizing  the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on ourselves and also work with those we condemn if we want to have a real impact. It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as enemies, even  those  who act violently. We have  to approach  them  with love in our  hearts  and do our  best to help them move in a direction  of nonviolence. If we work for peace out of anger, we will never succeed. Peace is not an end.  It can never  come  about  through non-peaceful means. When  we protest against a war, we may assume that we are a peaceful  person,  a representative of peace,  but this might  not be the case. If we look deeply, we will observe that  the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have been living. We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves  and others, therefore we are co-responsible: \"Because I have been like this, they are like that.\" A more holistic approach  is the way of \"interbeing\": \"This  is like this, because that is like that.\" This  is the way of understanding and love. With  this insight, we can see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go to a demonstration and say, \"This war is unjust, destructive,  and not worthy of our great nation.\" This is far more effective than angrily condemning others. Anger always accelerates the damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know how to write strong  letters  of protest,  but we must also learn  to write love letters  to our President  and Representatives, demonstrating the kind of understanding and using the kind of language  they will appreciate. If we don't, our letters may end up in the trash and help no one. To love is to understand. We cannot express love to someone unless we understand him or her. If we do not understand our President  or Congressperson, we cannot write him or her a love letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "People are happy to read a good letter in which we share our insights  and our understanding. When  they receive that kind of letter, they feel understood and they will pay attention to your recommendations. You may think that the way to change the world is to elect a new President, but a government is only a reflection of society, which is a reflection of our own consciousness. To create fundamental change, we, the members of society, have to transform ourselves. If we want real peace, we have to demonstrate our love and understanding so that those responsible for making decisions can learn from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry and frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is capable of understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there is a bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara who has 1,000 arms and 1,000 hands, and has an eye in the palm of each hand. One thousand hands represent action, and the eye in each hand represents understanding.  When you understand  a situation  or a person, any action you do will help and will not cause more suffering. When  you have an eye in your hand, you will know how to practice true nonviolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine if each of our words also had an eye in it. It is\n",
      "\n",
      "easy to depict a hand with an eye, but how might an artist also put an eye into our words? Before we say something, we have to understand what we are saying and the person to whom our words are directed. With  the eye of understanding, we will not say things to make the other person suffer. Blaming and arguing are forms of violence. When we speak, if we suffer greatly, our words may be bitter, and that will not help anyone. We have to learn to calm our selves and become a flower before we speak. This is \"the art of loving speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Listening is also a deep practice. The  bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara has a deep talent for listening. In Chinese, his name means \"listening to the cries of the world.\" We have to listen in a way that we understand the suffering of others. We have to empty ourselves and leave space so we can listen well. If we breathe in and out to refresh and empty ourselves, we will be able to sit still and listen to the person who is suffering. When she is suffering, she needs someone to listen attentively without judging or reacting. If she cannot find someone in her family, she may go to a psychotherapist. Just by listening deeply, we already alleviate a great  deal of her pain. This  is an important practice  of peace. We have to listen in our families and in our communities. We have to listen to everyone, especially those we consider our enemies. When we show our capacity of listening and understanding, the other person will also listen to us, and we will have a chance to tell him of our pain. This is the beginning of healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking is at the base of everything. It is important for us to put an eye of awareness into each of our thoughts. Without a correct understanding of a situation or a person, our thoughts can be misleading and create confusion, de spair, anger, or hatred. Our most important task is to de velop correct insight. If we see deeply into the nature of interbeing, that all things \"inter-are,\" we will stop blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with everyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "These  are the three domains of action-body, speech, and mind. In addition, there is <i>non-action, </i>which is often more important than action. Without our doing anything, things can sometimes go more smoothly  just because of our peaceful presence. In a small boat when a storm comes, if one person remains solid and calm, others will not panic, and the boat is more likely to stay afloat. In many circumstances, non-action can help a lot. A tree merely breathes, waves its leaves and branches, and tries to stay fresh. But if the tree were not there, we could not be here. The  tree's non-action is fundamental to our welbeing. If we can learn to live the way a tree does-staying fresh and solid, peaceful and calm-even if we do not do many things, others will benefit from our non-action, our presence. We can also practice non-action  in the domain of speech. Words can create understanding and mutual acceptance, or they can cause others to suffer. Sometimes it is best not to say anything. This is a book on nonviolent social action, but we must also discuss nonviolent  non-action. If we really want to help the world, the practice of non-action is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, sometimes non-action can be harmful. When someone needs our help and we refuse, she may die. If a monk, for example, sees a woman drowning and does not want to touch her because of his precepts, he will violate the most fundamental principle of life. When we see social injustice, if we practice non-action, we may cause harm. When people need us to say or do something, if we don't, we can kill by our inaction or our silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "To practice ahimsa, we must first of all learn ways to deal peacefully with ourselves. If we create true harmony within ourselves, we will know how to deal with family, friends, and associates. Techniques  are always secondary. Most important is to become ahimsa, so that when a situation  presents itself, we will not create  more suffering. To practice ahimsa, we need gentleness, loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity directed to our  bodies, our  feelings, and other  people.\n",

      "With  mindfulness-the practice of peace-we can begin by working  to transform the wars in ourselves. There are techniques  for doing this. Conscious  breathing is one. Every time we feel upset, we can stop what we are doing, refrain from saying anything,  and breathe in and out several times, aware of each in-breath and each out-breath. If we are still upset, we can go for walking meditation, mindful of each slow step and each breath  we take. By cultivating peace within,  we bring about  peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in ourselves is to minimize the numbers of wars between this and that feeling, or this and that perception, and we can then have real peace with others as well, including  the members of our own family.\n",

      "patience  and someone  breaks into your house and tries to kidnap your daughter or kill your husband?  What should you do? Should  you shoot  that person or act in a nonviolent way?\" The  answer depends  on your state of being. If you are prepared, you may react calmly and intelligently, in the most nonviolent  way possible. But to be ready to react with intelligence  and nonviolence, you have to train yourself in advance. It may take ten years, or longer. If you wait until  the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too late. A this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial moment, even if you know that nonviolence  is better than violence, if your understanding is only intellectual and not in your whole being, you will not act nonviolently. The fear and anger  in you will prevent you from acting in the most nonviolent  way.\n",

If another war does come, we will know that we have done our best. Is ten years enough  time to prepare ourselves and our nation to avoid another  war? How much time does it take to breathe consciously, to smile, and to be fully present in each moment?  Our real enemy is forgetfulness. If we nourish mindfulness every day and water  the seeds of peace in ourselves and those around  us, we have a good chance to prevent the next war and to defuse the next crisis.\n",

      "Immediately after ordering the ground attack on Iraq, in February 1991, President  Bush addressed his nation, saying, \"Whatever you are doing at this moment, please stop and pray for our soldiers in the Gulf. God Bless the United States  of America.\"  I suspect  that at the same moment many Moslems were also praying to their God to protect Iraq and the Iraqi soldiers. How could God know which nation to support? Many people pray to God because they want God  to fulfill some of their needs. If they want to have a picnic, they may ask God for a clear, sunny day. At the same time, farmers who need more rain might pray for the opposite. If the weather is clear, the picknickers may say, \"God is on our side; he answered our prayers.\" But if it rains, the farmers will say that God heard  <i>their  </i>prayers. This is the way we usually pray.\n",

      "In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught, <i>\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\" </i>Those who work for peace must have a peaceful  heart. When you have a peaceful heart, you are the child of God. But many who work for peace are not at peace. They still have anger and frustration, and their work is not really peaceful. We cannot say that they belong to the Kingdom of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "To preserve peace, our hearts must be at peace with the world, with our brothers and our sisters. When we try. To overcome evil with evil, we are not working for peace. If you say, \"Saddam Hussein is evil. We have to prevent him from continuing  to be evil,\" and if you then use the same means he has been using, you are exactly like him. Trying to overcome evil with evil is not the way to make peace.\n",

      "Jesus also said, <i>\"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.

      "In the Persian  Gulf, many people practiced  killing in their minds-Iraqi, American, French, British, and other soldiers. They knew that if they didn't kill, the enemy sol diers would kill them, so they used sandbags to represent their enemy, and holding their bayonets firmly, they ran, shouted, and plunged  the  bayonets  into  the sandbags. They  practiced killing day and night in their hearts and minds. The damage caused by that kind of practice is huge. I happened to see a few seconds of that kind of practice on TV. Even if President Bush had not given the order for a land offensive, a lot of damage was already being done in the minds and hearts of one million people in the Gulf. Those kinds of wounds last for a long time and are transmitted  to future generations. If you train yourself every day to kill during the day and then dream of killing during the night because you have spent so much time concentrating on that, the damage is deep. If you survive, you will bear that kind of scar for many years. This is a real tragedy. We usually count  bodies to measure the damage from a war, but we don't count these kinds of wounds in the hearts and minds of so many soldiers. We have to see the real long-term damage that war causes. Soldiers live in hell day and night, even before they go into the battlefield, and even after they return home.\n",

      "We may think of peace as the absence of war, that if the great powers would reduce their weapons arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we will see our own minds-our own prejudices, fears, and ignorance.  Even if we transport all the  bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of the bombs are still here-in our hearts and minds-and, sooner or later, we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To start a war and give the opportunity to one million men and women to practice killing day and night in their hearts is to plant many, many seeds of war-anger, frustration, and the fear of being killed.

      "This is Jesus' teaching about revenge. \"When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When he wants to borrow something from you, lend it to him. How many Christians actually practice this? There  is a story about an American soldier who was taking a Japanese prisoner during World War II. While walking together, the American discovered that the Japanese soldier spoke English and that he had been a Christian before he abandoned his faith. So he asked, \"Why did you abandon Christianity? It is an excellent religion,\" and the Japanese man said, \"I could not become a soldier and continue  to be a Christian. I don't think a good Christian  can become a soldier and kill another person.\" He understood this passage from Matthew. There  must be ways to solve our conflicts without having to resort to killing. We must focus our attention  on this. We have to find ways to help people get out of difficult situations, situations of conflict, without having to kill.\n",

      "This is nondiscrimination. When you pray only for your own picnic and not for the farmers who need the rain, you are doing the opposite  of what Jesus taught. Jesus said, \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you...\" When we look deeply into our anger, we see that the person we call our enemy is also suffering. As soon as we see that, we have the capacity of accepting and having compassion for him. Jesus called this \"loving your enemy.\" When we are able to love our enemy, he or she is no longer our enemy. The  idea of \"enemy\" vanishes and is replaced by the no tion of someone suffering a great deal who needs our com passion. Doing  this is sometimes  easier than we might think, but we need to practice. If we read the Bible but don't practice, it will not help much.\n",

We want to begin anew. \"You, my brother or sister, have wronged me in the past. I now understand that it was because you were suffering and did not see clearly. I no longer feel anger towards you.\" That  kind of forgiveness is the fruit of awareness. When you are mindful you can see all the causes that led the other person to make you suffer. When you see this, forgiveness  and release arise naturally. You can't  force yourself to forgive. Only when you understand  what has happened can you have compassion for the other  person and forgive him or her.\n",

President Gorbachev made a number of proposals that could have been acceptable  to the allies, and many lives could have been spared. But because anger was there, Mr. Bush rejected  Mr. Gorbachev's  proposals,  and Mr. Hussein gave the order to burn Kuwaiti oil wells. If President Bush had seen clearly the suffering of the Iraqi people, he would not have allowed his anger to be expressed by starting a war.

You are more than that. You may have lost just a few hundred American lives, but you also suffered from the Gulf War in many other ways. The deaths of so many Iraqi soldiers and civilians are also casualties that America suffered,  because their death was your country's work. When President Bush said, \"God bless the United States of America,\" he was not paying enough attention to the lives of non-Americans. To those of us who are not American, this was not a good image of America. It was selfish and arrogant, and this was also a casualty that America suffered-not just by guns and bombs, but by your President's statement. If the President had said, \"God bless us so that the war will end soon and that Americans as well as Iraqis will suffer as little as possible,\" he could have won a lot more sympathy from people around the world.

You cannot plunge a bayonet into a person without first transforming yourself into a beast. On the other side, one million Iraqi soldiers were practicing the same. One and a half million solders were practicing violence, hatred, and fear, and the American public supported  them to do so. They thought that this war was somehow clean, quick, and moral. They saw only bridges and buildings  being destroyed, but the real casualties were the souls of the men and women who came home after practicing violence for so many months.\n",

If you are a psychologist, a playwright, a novelist, a composer,  a filmmaker,  a lawyer, a legislator, a peacemaker, or an environmentalist, please look deeply into the souls of the soldiers who returned from the war so you can see the real suffering that war causes, not only to soldiers, but to everyone. Then  project that image onto a huge screen for the whole nation to see and to learn. If we are able to share the truth  concerning  the Gulf War, we will be able to avoid starting another war like it in the future. We have to see how deep the wounds of war are.

If we don't turn on the TV, we eat or read or talk on the telephone. We are always trying to fill our void with something. Some people even do social or political work this way. But doing this only makes us less satisfied, hungrier, and we want to consume more. We feel alienated from ourselves. There  is so much anger and fear in us, and we want to suppress them, so we consume more and more things that only increase the level of toxicity  in us.

Then  I continued  the lecture. In the afternoon,  one American student  told me, \"Thay, I think you have to go to the United States. Many friends there feel the same as you do, and it would help if you would go and support them.\" I did not say anything. I practiced breathing, walking, and sitting,  and a few days later, I decided to go. I saw that I was one with the American people, with George Bush, and with Saddam Hussein. I had been angry with President Bush, but after breathing consciously and looking deeply, I saw myself as President  Bush. I had not been practicing well enough to change this situation.

It is because we are not happy enough that we had a war. If we were happier, we would not take refuge in alcohol, drugs, war, and violence. Young people tell me that the most precious gift their parents can give is their own happiness. If Father and Mother  themselves are happy, the children  will receive seeds of happiness in their consciousness, and when they grow up, they will know how to make others happy too. When  parents fight, they sow seeds of suffering in the hearts of their children, and with that kind of heritage, children grow up unhappy. These are the roots of war.

If we practice walking mindfully, being in touch with the earth,  the air, the trees, and ourselves, we can heal ourselves, and our entire society will also be healed.

When  there is good communication between the hand and the rest of the body, both the hand and the body will feel better.

But if your guilt persists for too long and becomes a complex, it blocks the way to joy and peace. The  way to liberate  yourself is to look deeply into the nature  of the guilt and self-hatred  and see the seeds of the suffering your ancestors, your parents, and the violence and lack of understanding in our society and its institutions.

      "When you came home after the war, the American people were cool, neglectful, and unappreciative, and of course you became angry. But your people did not know anything about  the war. Both hawks and doves had a very wrong view. You experienced the reality firsthand, and when you see that they were speaking out of ignorance, you will stop being angry at them. You were ignorant  too, but now you have learned, and you are liberated from your anger. Now you can offer your compassion.\n",

      "We who have experienced war directly have a responsibility to share our insight and experience concerning  the truth of war. We are the light at the tip of the candle. It is very hot, but it has the power of shining and illuminating. We can gather into groups to support each other. Practicing mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into the nature of the war and, with our insight, awaken our own people. We know what war is. We also know that the war is not only in us; it is in everyone-veterans and non-veterans. We must share our insight, not out of anger, but out of love. Our people need us to do it. I am trying my best, and I hope my friends will do the same.\n",

      "During the war, one portion of the American population had to confront one portion of the Vietnamese population. These were the soldiers, the combatants. But the combatants and the non-combatants were not so different. In both, there were conflicts, and we have to look deeply to recognize these conflicts so that we can transform  them into understanding and compassion,  the fruit of insight. Insight can be brought about by mindfulness and looking deeply. If we do not have enough  mindfulness,  if we do not make enough  effort to look deeply, we will not have enough insight to transform  the conflicts that are within us, not to mention  those between people and those with other nations.\n",

      "The  basic condition for happiness is to be understood. Our  pain, hope, and despair  have to be understood  by someone for us to be happy. Vietnam veterans do not feel understood by their society, not even by members of their own  families.  Consciously or  unconsciously, veterans blame  the  non-veterans for  not  understanding them. There is so much misunderstanding to be dissolved. Veterans have suffered so much, and they have to take the time to understand their  own suffering. It may look as if the people of America understand  Gulf War veterans better, but I don't think so. Our ignorance about the nature of war is exactly the same. The war in Vietnam and the war in the Gulf were the same. It does not change  just by the way people welcome you back. Whether they shout at you or wave flags and welcome you, the true nature of the war is the same. We have to see that.\n",

      "Many years have now passed since the Vietnam War. We are calm enough to realize that the Vietnam War was not necessary. We spent so much energy, so many human lives-millions of people died in Vietnam. There are still a lot of mines and bombs in Vietnam that have not been defused, and there are also many bombs in our souls that have not been defused. We need to defuse the bombs in our souls first. Then we can go to Vietnam to help defuse the bombs there.\n",

      "When we look deeply, we can see that all wars have their roots in the lack of understanding. We may be a little wiser now that twenty years have passed since the Vietnam War, but are we wise enough to prevent another war? In fact, we have already had another unnecessary war. In order to prevent yet another, we have to be prepared. We need time, of course, but we also need a way. If we know what to do, how to prepare, time is of secondary importance. We have to practice in a way that helps the whole nation see deeply into the nature of war. \n",

You have been embracing your suffering for many years, but when you see it directly, <i>it </i>will transform itself into a positive source of energy that will empower you to share your insight. To help others, we have to go to them with arms extended, filled with loving kindness and compassion. Blaming others or blaming ourselves can never help.

We cannot call it a victory. You cannot call the Gulf War a victory either. But many Americans did call it a victory, so they could have the feeling once again that America is the greatest power on Earth. They organized parades welcoming the soldiers back, trying to overcome what they called a defeat many years ago.\n",

Please look deeply and remove all of these false distinctions. Look deeply to see the true nature of our society and our collective consciousness.

      "As long as the American people believe that  the Gulf War was moral, just, and liberating, they will be tempted to do the same thing the next time there is a conflict. How can we prevent that? By telling the truth,  by sharing our insight. We need to look deeply and to share our insights. We do not have time to embrace our pain in private anymore. We have to reveal ourselves. We have to allow our selves to be the light at the tip of the candle, and to join with other veterans. We who have had firsthand experience can share the reality with everyone.\n",

      "Transformation is the key. Looking just into the ocean of suffering, you see  that  it is immense. But if you turn around, you see the land. It is possible to transform  our hearts right in the present moment. If we do it, if we vow to go in the direction of peace and service, a rose will be born in us at that very moment. My brothers  and sisters who died during the war have been reborn as flowers. We have to harvest those flowers and form a beautiful bouquet. Please don't dwell on your memory of guilt.

      "Several autumns ago, I walked up to the pine tree in my backyard and asked it one question: \"What is institutional violence?\" The  tree did not answer right away. So I sat at its roots and waited. The  backyard was covered with brilliantly colored leaves, the air was fresh, and suddenly I forgot that I was waiting for an answer. The  tree and I were just there, enjoying ourselves and each other. After sitting for a long time, I turned to the tree, smiled, and said, \"I no longer need an answer.\" Then  I thanked it and awarded it the Grand Transnational Peace Prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "When  I told my friends this, one asked, \"Do you give the Peace Prize often?\" I did not know how to answer. I wanted to, but it was difficult. Then another asked, \"What was the tree's answer to your question?\" Again, I did not know what to say, so I encouraged  her to go out and ask the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a novice monk, I was taught to look deeply at a cypress tree, and I learned that looking at a cypress can be very helpful. In fact, it is often easier to contemplate a cypress than to talk to a person. Before talking to a human being, watching a cypress can help. Soon I will organize an International Conference on Tree-Watching. All of the conferees will sit in the forest and just look at beautiful cypresses and pines. Then, in workshops, we can discuss strategies for tree-watching and also principles for appreciating human beings, even those who do not look or think exactly as we do. When I told this to the pine tree, it began to laugh. The tree was thinking about a particular conference held at a Hilton  Hotel dealing with the problems of the Third World. Not a single Third World representative had the opportunity to speak because eloquent spokespersons from the First World spoke for them. It was too difficult for them to listen to real Third World representatives, especially those whose ideas did not fit in with their own.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yesterday, I stood in a park and watched a three-year-old child with all my attention, and I was heartbroken. When people say, \"Things aren't too bad,\" I am not sure they understand. If we continue to live the way we do, what kind of world are we leaving for our children? Are we leaving any world at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my brother is still alive, and I will travel all over the world to find him. But I really need your help. Will you help me? He may be hard to recognize, but I believe the  time is near.

We were busy doing  other  things practicing meditation, praying, reciting scriptures. We were not at all awake. \n",

That is why we did not want him. But I can assure you that one person like my brother  counts for a lot. I have confidence in my brother now, because as I think of him, I feel that anything is possible. Please help. Please be attentive. If you are attentive enough, you will find my brother. Please do not leave me in distress. Tell me, write me, telephone me the moment you see him. I know it may be hard to recognize him, but he is around.

      "\n",
      "Twenty years ago, I wrote four Chinese characters on a paper lampshade: \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately.\"  A few years later, in Singapore, I had the chance to practice these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 1976, and several of us were conducting an operation to rescue boat people in the Gulf of Siam. The project was called, \"When blood is shed, we all suffer.\" At that time, not many people knew about the presence of the boat people, and the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore would not allow them to land on their shores. The practice was to push the boat people back out to sea so they would die, and those on land would not have to deal with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hired two large ships-the <i>Leapdal </i>and the <i>Roland </i>to pick up refugees on the open sea, and two small ships the <i>Saigon 200 </i>and the <i>Blackmark-to </i>communicate  between the larger ships and to transport water, food, medicine, and supplies. Our plan was to fill the two large ships with refugees and take them to Australia and Guam, where, on arrival, we would inform the press so that the world would take notice of their plight, and they would not be sent back. In Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries, thousands of boat people had been sent back and many of them died in the sea. We had to do our work in secret, since the governments of the world did not want to acknowledge the plight of the boat people, and we knew we would be deported from Singapore if we were discovered. We managed to rescue nearly 800 boat people from the Gulf of Siam. On New Year's Eve, I rode out to sea in the small <i>Saigon 200 </i>to talk with the refugees on the larger ships. Using a wireless telephone, I wished them a Happy New Year. After we said good-bye, I headed back to shore, and, in the darkness, a huge wave welled up and drenched me. I had the impression that the power of darkness was warning me, \"It is the fate of these people to die. Why are you interfering?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we asked fishermen to pick these boat people up during the night, and then we took them by taxi to the French Embassy. In the morning, they were discovered by the French Ambassador, who was very kind. He called the police, knowing that because of his awareness of the presence of these people, they would get \"illegal refugee\" status. Even though they were put in prison, it was far better than being sent back to sea. Then we worked to help these people get accepted to go to France. We were trying to do many things to reverse the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time, we saw things you cannot  believe. We met with a group of sixty people in a barracks. They had just destroyed  their own boat so that the Malaysian police would not send them back out to sea, but the police were trying to repair their  boat in order  to do just that. When we saw these people, the men were just staring into empty space, and the women and children could not stop crying. One of them told us that they came with two boats. The Malaysian police had given them some water and told them to go to Singapore, where they would be welcomed, but this was not  true-the Singaporeans always towed boats back out into the ocean no matter how dangerous it was for the boat people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When  the two boats tried to sail away from Malaysia, one capsized. The sixty people on this boat had witnessed the deaths of everyone on the other boat, right in front of their eyes, and there was nothing they could do to help. So they decided to return to the shores of Malaysia, and this time they destroyed and sank their own boat the moment they arrived. They  did not want to be pushed out to sea again. We immediately went to the nearest town and called Reuters, AFP, and other  media people to come and take photographs. Because of this, the police did not send them back out to sea, but instead brought  them to prison and later to a refugee camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  suffering we touched doing this kind of work was so deep  that  if we did not  have a reservoir  of spiritual strength, we would not have been able to continue. During those days, we practiced sitting  and walking meditation, and eating our meals in silence in a very concentrated way. We knew that without this kind of discipline, we would fail in our work. The  lives of many people depended on our mindfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we had rescued nearly 800 people from small boats at sea, the government of Singapore discovered  us. We were close to succeeding in sending  the <i>Roland </i>and the <i>Leapdal </i>to Australia, but because of a leak to the press, several reporters tracked us down and published a story about our project. The press is sometimes  frivolous; they just want to write a story, even if human lives are at stake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because we had been exposed, the Singapore authorities gave the order for the police to surround  our flat at two o'clock in the morning. Two policemen were at the front door, two at the back, and two came in to get me. They took my travel documents and ordered me to leave the country within twenty-four hours. I knew that two large boatloads of people were waiting  for me to help bring them to shore. The police said, \"We will return your travel documents at the airport tomorrow.\" Those policemen were not like human beings. They were unable to understand the suffering of the boat people or how we were trying to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "What  could we do in such a situation? We had to breathe deeply and consciously. Otherwise we might panic, or fight with the police, or do something to express our anger at their lack of humanity. Knowing that in twenty-four hours we had to leave 800 people on two boats without food and water, what could we do? We could not go back to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time of the night, no one would answer phone calls. Even the French Embassy was not open. So all of us practiced walking meditation inside our small flat for the rest of the night. If you practice conscious breathing before some difficulty arises, you will be prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to find a way for 800 people to travel safely to Australia  or Guam. The  <i>Saigon 200 </i>and the <i>Blackmark </i>were not allowed to leave port to take food and water to the refugees on the <i>Leapdal </i>and the <i>Roland. </i>The <i>Roland </i>had enough fuel to reach Australia, but we needed to get food to them. Then its engine broke down. The day was very windy and the sea quite rough, and we worried about their safety, even just drifting offshore. But the Malaysian government would  not  allow the ship  to enter  Malaysian waters. I tried to get permission  to enter  a neighboring country in order to continue the rescue operation, but the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia would not grant me an entry visa. Even though I was on land, I too was drifting on the sea·, and my life was one with the 800 refugees on the ships. There were more problems than seemed possible to solve in just twenty-four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to practice the meditation topic, \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately,\" and I was surprised to find myself quite calm, not afraid or worried about anything. I was not just being careless. This was truly a peaceful state of mind, and in that state, I was able to overcome this difficult  situation. The  idea came to me to ask the French Embassy to intervene on my behalf so that my visa would be extended for a few more days, enough time to tie up all of these loose ends. And at five minutes before noon, just as the Immigration Department was about to close for the weekend and I would have to leave the country, the ex tension was granted. As long as I live, I will never forget those seconds of sitting meditation,  those breaths, those mindful steps during that night and that morning. Success came when I faced the problem directly. I vowed that if I could not have peace at that moment,  I would never be able to have peace. If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, the kind of peace I might realize in easier times would not mean anything. Practicing the topic, \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately,\" I was able to resolve many problems one after another. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had to hand the refugees over to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees,  who kept them  for months and years in the camps in Malaysia. It was very painful. Yet we had conducted our operation in prayer and meditation, because we knew that everything depended on our mindfulness. We did sitting  meditation  late into the night every night,  then recited the <i>Heart Sutra, </i>as if we were in a monastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our work did bring the cries of the boat people to the attention  of the world. In 1977, the U.S. government increased the quota for Vietnamese  refugees to 7,000 per year, then 15,000, then 100,000. Australia and other countries followed suit. If we do our best, in full awareness and with a heart free from anger, we cannot worry about results.\n",

I was not on the boat-in fact, I was thousands of miles away-but because I was mindful, I knew what was going on in the Gulf. \n",

      "As a novice in a Buddhist monastery, I was taught to be aware of each thing I did throughout the day, and for more than fifty years, I have been practicing this. When I started, I thought this kind of practice was only for beginners, that advanced people did more important things, but now I know that  the practice  of mindfulness is for everyone. Meditation  is to see into our own nature and wake up. If we are not aware of what is going on in ourselves and in the world, how can we see into our own nature and wake up? Are we really awake when we drink our tea, read our newspaper, or use the toilet?\n",

      "Our society makes it difficult for us to be awake. There are so many distractions. We know that 40,000 children in the Third World die of hunger every day, but we keep forgetting.

I know a number of friends  who refrain  from eating  dinner  two times each week in order  to remember the situation in the Third World.\n",

      "One day I asked a young Vietnamese refugee who was eating a bowl of rice whether children in his country eat rice of such high quality. He said no, because he knows the situation. He experienced hunger in Vietnam-there were times when he ate only dried potatoes, while he longed for a bowl of rice. In France, he has been eating rice for a year, and he is already beginning  to forget. But when I asked him, he remembered. I could not ask the same question to a French or American child, because they have not had the experience of hunger. It is difficult for people in the West to understand the situation in the Third World. It seems to have nothing to do with their situation. I told the Vietnamese boy that the rice he was eating in France came from Thailand, and that most Thai children do not have rice of such high quality, because the best rice is set aside for ex port to Japan and the West in exchange for foreign currency.\n",

      "In Vietnam we have a delicious banana called<i>chuối già, </i>but the children  and adults in Vietnam do not have the right to eat these bananas because they are all for export. In return, Vietnam gets guns in order to kill ourselves and our brothers. Some of us practice this exercise of mindfulness: We sponsor a child in the Third World and get news from him or her, thus keeping in touch with the reality outside. We try many ways to be awake, but our society still keeps us forgetful. Meditation is to help us remember. There are other  ways to nourish awareness. One thirteen-year-old Dutch  boy visited our retreat center  and joined us for a silent lunch. It was the first time he had eaten in silence, and he was embarrassed. Afterwards, I asked him if he had felt uncomfortable, and he said yes. I explained that the reason we eat in silence is to be in touch with the food and the presence of each other. If we talk a lot, we cannot enjoy these things. I asked him if there was some time when he turned off the TV in order to enjoy his dinner  more, and he said yes. Later in the day, I invited him to join us for another  silent meal, and he enjoyed it very much. Society bombards us with so many noises that we have lost our taste for silence. Every time we have a few minutes, we turn on the TV or make a phone call. We do not know how to be ourselves without something  to distract us. So, the first thing we need to do is to return to ourselves and reorganize our daily lives so that we are not just victims of society and other people.\n",

      "To educate people for peace, we can use words or we can speak with our lives. If we are not peaceful, if we are not feeling well in our skin, we cannot demonstrate real peace, and we cannot raise our children well either. To take good care of our children means to take good care of ourselves, to be aware of our situation. Please sit down with your child and, together, contemplate the little  flowers  that grow among the grasses. Breathing in and out, smiling together-that is real peace education. When we can learn to appreciate these small, beautiful things, we will not have to search for anything else. We can be peace ourselves, and we can make peace with our friends and even with our so called enemies.\n",

      "In 1951, I went with a few brother  monks to a remote mountain in the Dai Lao region of Vietnam  to build a meditation center. We asked some native mountain people for their help, and two Montagnards  from the Jarai tribe joined us in clearing the forest, cutting trees into lumber, and gathering other materials for construction. They were hard workers, and we were grateful for their assistance. But after working with us only three days, they stopped coming. Without their help, we had many difficulties, as we were not familiar with the ways of the forest. So we walked to their village and asked what had happened. They said, \"Why should we return so soon? You already paid us enough to live for a month! We will come again when we run out of rice.\" At the time, it was a common practice to un derpay the Montagnards,  to avoid just this kind of thing. We had paid them properly, and, surely enough, they stopped coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people criticized the Montagnards for this ethic.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said that this laziness could only lead to trouble, and they listed four reasons to support  their claim: (1) The Montagnards would be happier and more comfortable if they would work harder. (2) They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods. (3) The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others. (4) If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasions and the exploitation of others. There may be some validity to each of these points, but if we look closely at the lives of the Montagnards, we will come to understand them, and ourselves, better.\n",

      "1. <i>The Montagnards  would be happier and more comfortable if they would work harder.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Montagnards lived simply. They did not store much food at all. They had no bank accounts.  But they were much more serene and at peace with themselves, nature, and other  people, than almost anyone in the world. I am not suggesting that we all return  to primitive life-styles, but it is important  that we see and appreciate the wisdom contained in a life-style like this, a wisdom that those of us immersed  in modernization and economic  growth have lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much stuff do we need to be happy and comfortable? Happiness and comfort vary according to taste. Some people think they need three or four houses-one on the Riviera, one in New York, one in Tokyo, and perhaps one in Fiji. Others find that a two or three-room hut is quite enough. In fact, if you own a dozen luxurious houses, you may rarely have time to enjoy them. Even when you have the time, you may not know how to sit peacefully in one place. Always seeking distraction-going to restaurants, the theater, or dinner parties, or taking vacations that exhaust you even more, you can't stand being alone and facing yourself directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In former times, people spent hours drinking one cup of tea with dear friends. A cup of tea does not cost much, but today, we go to a cafe and take less than five minutes  to drink our tea or coffee, and even during that short time, we are mostly thinking and talking about other things, and we never even notice our tea. We who own just one house barely have the time to live in it. We leave home early in the morning  after a quick breakfast and go off to work, spending an hour in the car or the train and the rest of the day in the office. Then we return home exhausted, eat dinner, watch TV, and collapse so we can get up early for work. Is this \"progress\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Montagnards  were quite content to live in simple bamboo  and palm-leaf  huts and wash their  clothes  by hand. They  refused to be slaves to economic pressures. Content with just a few possessions, they rarely needed to spend their time or money seeing doctors or psychotherapists for stress-related ailments.\n",

      "\n",
      "People who accumulate a house, a car, a position, and so forth, identify themselves with what they own, and they think that if they lose their house, their car, or their position, they would not be themselves. To me, they are already lost. By accumulating  and saving, they have constructed a false self, and in the process they have forgotten their truest and deepest self. Psychotherapists  can try to help, but the cause of this illness is in their way of life. One way to help such a person would be to place him in an \"underdeveloped\" country where he could grow <i>his </i>own food and make his own clothes. Sharing the fate and simple life of peasants might help him heal quickly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course, the Montagnards could have spent more time working in order to send aid to people who were starving in other parts of the world. If they did not do so, it was because they didn't know much about the existence of other nations. They certainly did help their own tribal members whenever they got sick or when a crop was destroyed by some natural disaster. But let us reflect for a moment on\n",
      "what the Montagnard people did <i>not </i>do.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not harm or exploit others. They grew their own food and exchanged some of their products with other people. They did not do violence to nature. They cut only enough  wood to build their  houses. They  cleared  only enough land to plant their crops. Because of their simple life-style,  they did not overconsume natural  resources. They did not pollute the air, water, or soil. They used very little fuel and no electricity. They did not own private cars, dishwashers, or electric razors. The way they lived enabled natural resources to continually renew themselves. A lifestyle like theirs demonstrates that a future for humankind is possible, and this is the most helpful thing anyone can do to help others.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is true that the Montagnards were exploited by others and were often victims of social injustice. They lived in re mote mountain areas. If others settled nearby, they risked losing their land due to a lack of means with which to defend themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "People said that if the rest of us in Vietnam worked as little as they did, our country would never be able to resist foreign intervention  and exploitation. It seems clear that the Montagnards and others  like them had to do something  more. But what? If the Montagnards would have moved down to the more populated areas, they would have seen men and women working extremely hard and getting poorer. They would have seen how expensive food, lodging, electricity, water, clothing, and transportation were. Their civilized countrymen were working all day long and could barely pay for the most basic items they consumed. The Montagnards in the forest did not need to spend any money. If they would have lived and worked in the cities, how would that have helped Vietnam resist foreign intervention?  All they would have learned  is that in the socalled developed nations, resources are used to make bombs and other elaborate weapons, while many citizens live in misery. The Montagnards might well need nuclear weapons to resist foreign intervention if they were to catch up with their more \"developed\" brothers and sisters. Will social injustice ever be abolished before all people wake up and realize that unless we let others live, we ourselves will not be able to live?\n",

      "Economic growth may be necessary for the welfare of people,  but the present  rate of economic  growth  is destroying  humanity  and nature. Injustice is rampant.  We humans are part of nature, and doing harm to nature only harms us. It is not just the poor and oppressed who are victims  of environmental damage.  The  affluent  are  just as much victims of pollution  and the exploitation  of resources. We must look at the whole picture and ask, \"Does our way of life harm nature? Does our way of life harm our fellow humans? Do we live at the expense of others, at the expense of the present, and at the expense of the future?\" If we answer truthfully, we will know how to orient our lives and our actions.

      "Although Human beings are a part of nature, we single ourselves out and classify other animals and living beings as \"nature,\" while acting as if we were somehow separate from it. Then we ask, \"How should we deal with nature?\" We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! Nonviolently. We should not harm ourselves, and we should not harm nature. To harm nature is to harm ourselves, and vice versa. If we knew how to deal with ourselves and our fellow human beings, we would know how to deal with nature. Human beings and nature are inseparable. By not caring properly for either, we harm both.\n",

      "We can only be happy when we accept ourselves as we are. We must first be aware of all the elements within us, and then we must bring them into harmony. Our physical and mental well-being are the result of understanding what is going on in ourselves. This understanding helps us respect nature  in ourselves and also helps us bring about healing If we harm another  human being, we harm ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accumulate wealth and own excessive portions of the world's natural resources is to deprive our fellow humans of the chance to live. To participate in oppressive and unjust social systems is to widen the gap between rich and poor and thereby aggravate the situation of social injustice. Yet we tolerate excess, injustice, and war, while remaining unaware that the human race as a family is suffering. While some members of the human family are suffering and starving, for us to enjoy false security and wealth is a sign of insanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  fate of each individual is inextricably linked to the fate of the whole human race. We must let others live if we ourselves want to live. The only alternative to coexistence is co-nonexistence. A civilization in which we kill and ex ploit others for our own aggrandizement is sick. For us to have a healthy civilization, everyone must be born with an equal right to education, work, food, shelter, world citizenship, and the ability to circulate freely and settle on any part of the Earth. Political and economic systems that deny one person these rights harm the whole human family. We must begin by becoming aware of what is happening to every member of the human family if we want to repair the damage already done.\n",

      "To bring about  peace, we must work for harmonious coexistence. If we continue to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world, imprisoning ourselves in our narrow concerns  and immediate  problems, we are not likely to make peace or to survive. It is difficult for one individual to preserve harmony among the elements within himself, and it is even more difficult to preserve harmony among the members of the human family. We have to understand the human race to bring it into harmony. Cruelty and disruption destroy the harmony of the family. We need legislation  that  keeps us from doing  violence  to ourselves  or nature, and prevents us from being disruptive and cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have created a system that we cannot control. This system imposes itself on us, and we have become its slaves. Most of us, in order to have a house, a car, a refrigerator, a Tv, and so on, must sacrifice our time and our lives in exchange. We are constantly under the pressure of time. In former times, we could afford three hours for one cup of tea, enjoying the company of our friends in a serene and spiritual  atmosphere. We could organize a party to celebrate the blossoming of one orchid in our garden. But to day we can no longer afford these things. We say that time is money. We have created a society in which the rich be come richer and the poor become poorer, and in which we are so caught up in our own immediate problems that we cannot afford to be aware of what is going on with the rest of the human family. We see images on Tv, but we do not really understand our Third World brothers and sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The individual and all of humanity are both part of nature and should be able to live in harmony with nature. Nature can be cruel and disruptive and therefore, at times, needs to be controlled. To control is not to dominate or oppress  but to harmonize  and equilibrate. We must be deep friends with nature in order to control certain aspects of it. This  requires  a full understanding of nature. Typhoons, tornadoes, droughts, floods, volcanic eruptions, and proliferations of harmful insects all constitute danger and destruction to life. Although  parts of nature,  these things disrupt the harmony of nature. We should be able to prevent to a large degree the destruction that natural disasters cause, but we must do it in a way that preserves life and encourages harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  excessive use of pesticides that kill all kinds of insects and upset the ecological balance is an example of our lack of wisdom in trying  to control  nature. Economic growth that devastates nature by polluting and exhausting nonrenewable  resources, rendering  the Earth impossible for beings to live on, is another. Such economic growth may appear to benefit some humans, but in reality it disrupts and destroys the whole of nature to which we all belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harmony and equilibrium in the individual, society, and nature are being destroyed. Individuals are sick, society is sick, and nature is sick. We must reestablish harmony and equilibrium, but how? Where can we begin the work of healing? Would we begin with the individual, society, or the environment? We must work in all three  domains. People of different disciplines tend to stress their particular areas. For example, politicians consider an effective rearrangement of society necessary for the salvation of humans and nature, and therefore urge that everyone engage in the struggle to change political systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We Buddhist monks are like psychotherapists in that we tend to look at the problem from the viewpoint of mental health. Meditation  aims at creating harmony and equilibrium in the life of the individual. Buddhist meditation uses the breath as a tool to calm and harmonize the whole human being. As in any therapeutic practice, the patient is placed in an environment that favors the restoration  of harmony. Usually psychotherapists  spend their time observing and then advising their patients. I know of some, however, who, like monks, observe themselves first, recognizing the need to free their own selves from the fears, anxieties, and despair that exist in each of us. Many therapists seem to think that they themselves have no mental problems, but the monk recognizes in himself the susceptibility to fears and anxieties, and to the mental illness that is caused by the inhuman social and economic systems that prevail in today's world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buddhists believe that the reality of the individual, society, and nature's integral being will reveal itself to us as we recover, gradually ceasing to be possessed by anxiety, fear, and the dispersion of mind. Among the three-individual, society, and nature-it is the individual who begins to effect change. But in order to effect change, he or she must have personally recovered, must be whole. Since this requires an environment favorable to healing, he or she must seek the kind of life-style that is free from destructiveness. Efforts to change the environment and to change the individual are both necessary, but it is difficult to change the environment if individuals are not in a state of equilibrium. From the mental health point of view, efforts for us to recover our humanness should be given priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restoring mental health does not mean simply helping individuals adjust to the modern world of rapid economic growth. The world is sick, and adapting to an unwell environment will not bring real health. Many people who seek the help of a psychotherapist are really victims of modem life, which separates human beings from the rest of nature. One way to help such a person may be to move him or her to a rural area where he can cultivate the land, grow his own food, wash his clothes in a clear river, and live simply, sharing  the same life as millions of peasants around  the world. For psychotherapy to be effective, we need environmental change, and psychotherapists must participate  in efforts to change the environment. But that is only half their task. The  other half is to help individuals be themselves, not by helping them adapt to an ill environment, but by providing them with the strength  to change it. To tranquilize them is not the way. The explosion of bombs, the burning of napalm, the violent deaths of relatives and neighbors, the pressures  of time, noise, and pollution, the lonely crowds have all been created by the disruptive course of our economic  growth. They  are all sources of mental illness, and they must end. Anything we can do to bring them to an end is preventive medicine. Political activities are not the only means to this end.\n",
      "\n",
      "While helping their particular patients, psychotherapists must, at the same time, recognize  their responsibility  to the whole human family. Their work must also prevent others  from becoming  ill. They  are challenged  to safe guard their own humanness. Like others, psychotherapists and monks need to observe first themselves and their own ways of life. If they do, I believe they will seek ways to disengage  themselves  from  the present  economic  systems in order  to help reestablish  harmony and balance in life. Monks and psychotherapists are human beings. We cannot escape mental illness if we do not apply our disciplines to ourselves. Caught in forgetfulness and acquiescence to the status quo, we will gradually become victims of fear, anxiety, and egotism of all kinds. But if psychotherapists  and monks, through mutual sharing, help each other apply our disciplines  to our own lives, we will rediscover  the harmony in ourselves and thereby help the whole human family.\n",

There  was a beautiful hillside, lush with trees and flowers, and on it was a little house. But each time I approached the hillside, obstacles prevented me from climbing it, and then I woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  dream recurred many times. I continued to do my work and to practice mindfulness,  trying to be in touch with the beautiful trees, people, flowers, and sunshine that surrounded me in Europe  and North America. I looked deeply at these things, and I played under the trees with the children exactly as I had in Vietnam. Mter a year, the dream  stopped. Seeds of acceptance and  joy had been planted in me, and I began to look at Europe, America, and other countries in Asia as also my home. I realized that my home is the Earth. Whenever I felt homesick for Vietnam, I went outside into a backyard or a park, and found a place to practice  breathing, walking, and smiling  among  the trees.\n",

      "But some cities had very few trees, even then. I can imagine someday soon a city with no trees in it at all. Imagine a city that has only one tree left. People there are mentally disturbed, because they are so alienated from nature. Then one doctor in the city sees why people are getting sick, and he offers each person who comes to him this prescription: \"You are sick because you are cut off from Mother Nature. Every morning, take a bus, go to the tree in the center of the city, and hug it for fifteen minutes. Look at the beautiful green tree and smell its fragrant bark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After three months  of practicing  this, the patient will feel much better. But because many people suffer from the same malady and the doctor  always gives the same prescription, after a short time, the line of people waiting their tum to embrace the tree gets to be very long, more than a mile, and people begin to get impatient. Fifteen minutes is now too long for each person to hug the tree, so the city council legislates a five-minute maximum. Then  they have to shorten it to one minute, and then only a few seconds. Finally, there is no remedy at all for the sickness.\n",

      "If we are not mindful,  we might  be in that situation soon. We have to remember that our body is not limited to what lies within  the boundary of our skin. Our  body is much more immense.  We know that  if our  heart  stops beating, the flow of our life will stop, but we do not take the time to notice the many things outside of our bodies that are equally essential for our survival. If the ozone layer around our Earth were to disappear for even an instant, we would die. If the sun were to stop shining, the flow of our life would stop. The sun is our second heart, our heart outside of our body. It gives all life on Earth the warmth necessary for existence. Plants live thanks to the sun. Their leaves absorb the sun's energy, along with carbon dioxide from the air, to produce food for the tree, the flower, the plankton. And thanks to plants, we and other animals can live. All of us-people, animals,  plants, and minerals-\"consume\" the sun, directly and indirectly. We cannot begin to describe all the effects of the sun, that great heart outside of our body.\n",

When we think of a speck of dust, a flower, or a human being, our thinking cannot break loose from the idea of unity, of one, of calculation. We see a line drawn between one and many, one and not one. But if we truly realize the interdependent nature of the dust, the flower, and the human being, we see that unity cannot  exist without  diversity.

We are imprisoned in our small selves, thinking only of some comfortable conditions for this small self, while we destroy our large self. If we want to change the situation, we must begin by being our true selves. To be our true selves means we have to <i>be </i>the forest, the river, and the ozone layer. If we visualize our selves as the forest, we will experience the hopes and fears of the trees. If we don't do this, the forests will die, and we will lose our chance for peace.

We have to remember  our past existences and be humble. We can learn a lot from an oak tree.\n",

      "All life is impermanent. We are all children of the Earth, and, at some time, she will take us back to herself again. We are continually arising from Mother Earth, being nurtured  by her, and then returning to her. Like us, plants are born, live for a period of time, and then return to the Earth. When  they decompose, they fertilize our gardens. Living vegetables and decomposing vegetables are part of the same reality. Without one, the other cannot be. After six months, compost becomes fresh vegetables again. Plants  and the Earth  rely on each other.  Whether the Earth  is fresh, beautiful, and green, or arid and parched depends on the plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also depends on us. Our way of walking on the Earth has a great influence on animals and plants. We have killed so many animals and plants and destroyed their environments. Many are now extinct. In turn, our environment is now harming us. We are like sleepwalkers, not knowing what we are doing or where we are heading. Whether we can wake up or not depends on whether we can walk mindfully on our Mother Earth. The future of all life, including our own, depends on our mindful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birds' songs express joy, beauty, and purity, and evoke in us vitality and love. So many beings in the universe love us unconditionally. The trees, the water, and the air don't ask anything of us; they just love us. Even though we need this kind of love, we continue to destroy them. By destroying the animals, the air, and the trees, we are destroying ourselves. We must learn to practice unconditional love for all beings so that the animals, the air, the trees, and the minerals can continue to be themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our ecology should be a deep ecology-not only deep, but universal. There is pollution  in our consciousness. Television, films, and newspapers are forms of pollution for us and our children. They sow seeds of violence and anxiety in us and pollute our consciousness, just as we destroy our environment by farming with chemicals, clear-cutting the trees, and polluting the water. We need to protect the ecology of the Earth and the ecology of the mind, or this kind of violence and recklessness will spill over into even more areas of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Earth, our green beautiful Earth is in danger, and all of us know it. Yet we act as if our daily lives have nothing to do with the situation of the world. If the Earth were your body, you would be able to feel many areas where she is suffering. Many people are aware of the world's suffering, and their hearts are filled with compassion. They know what needs to be done, and they engage in political, social, and environmental work to try to change things. But after a period of intense involvement, they become discouraged, because they lack the strength needed to sustain a life of action. Real strength  is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we change our daily lives-the way we think, speak, and act-we change the world. The  best way to take care of the environment is to take care of the environmentalist. Many Buddhist teachings help us understand our inter connectedness with our Mother,  the Earth.  One of the deepest is the <i>Diamond Sutra, </i>which is written in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and his senior disciple, Subhuti. It begins  with  this  question  by Subhuti: \"If daughters and sons of good families wish to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind, what should they rely on and what should they do to master their thinking?\" This is the same as asking, \"If I want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and principles should I use?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Buddha answers, \"We have to do our best to help every living being cross the ocean of suffering. But after all beings have arrived at the shore of liberation, no being at all has been carried to the other shore. If you are still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a life span, you are not an authentic bodhisattva.\" Self, person, living being, and life span are four notions that pre vent us from seeing reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is one. We do not need to slice it into pieces and call this or that piece a \"self.\" What we call a self is made only of non-self elements. When  we look at a flower, for example, we may think that it is different from \"non-flower\" things. But when we look more deeply, we see that everything in the cosmos is in that flower. Without  all of the non-flower elements-sunshine, clouds, earth, minerals, heat, rivers, and consciousness-a flower cannot be. That is why the Buddha teaches that the self does not exist. We have to discard all distinctions between self and non-self. How can anyone work to protect the environment without this insight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The second notion that prevents us from seeing reality is the notion of a person, a human being. We usually discriminate between humans and non-humans, thinking that we are more important than other species. But since we humans are made of non-human elements, to protect our selves we have to protect all of the non-human  elements. There is no other way. If you think, \"God created man in His own image and He created other  things for man to use,\" you are already making the discrimination that man is more  important than  other  things.  When  we see that humans have no self, we see that to take care of the environment (the non-human elements) is to take care of humanity. The best way to take good care of men and women so that they can be truly healthy and happy is to take care of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know ecologists who are not happy in their families. They work hard to improve the environment, partly to escape family life. If someone is not happy within himself, how can he help the environment? That is why the Buddha teaches that to protect the non-human elements is to protect humans, and to protect humans is to protect non-human elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third notion we have to break through is the notion of a living being. We think that we living beings are different from inanimate objects, but according to the principle of interbeing, living beings are comprised of non-living being elements. When  we look into  ourselves,  we see minerals and all  other non-living-being elements. Why discriminate against what we call inanimate? To protect living beings, we must protect the stones, the soil, and the oceans. Before the atomic bomb was dropped  on Hiroshima, there  were many beautiful stone  benches in the parks. As the Japanese were rebuilding their city, they dis covered that these stones were dead, so they carried them away and buried them. Then  they brought in live stones. Do not think these things are not alive. Atoms are always moving. Electrons move at nearly the speed of light. Ac cording to the teaching of Buddhism,  these atoms and stones are consciousness itself. That is why discrimination by living beings against non-living beings should be dis carded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  last notion is that of a life span. We think that we have been alive since a certain point in time and that prior to that moment, our life did not exist. This distinction between life and non-life is not correct. Life is made of death, and death  is made of life. We have to accept  death;  it makes life possible. The cells in our body are dying every day, but we never think to organize funerals for them. The death of one cell allows for the birth of another. Life and death are two aspects of the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so that others may live. This deep meditation brings forth non-fear, non-anger, and non-despair, the strengths we need for our work. With non-fear, even when we see that a problem is huge, we will not burn out. We will know how to make small, steady steps. If those who work to protect the environment  contemplate  these four notions, they will know how to be and how to act.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another Buddhist text, the <i>Avatamsaka ('Adorning theBuddha with Flowers') Sutra, </i>the Buddha further elaborates his insights concerning our \"interpenetration\" with our environment. Please meditate with me on the \"Ten Penetrations\":\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is, \"All worlds penetrate a single pore. A single pore penetrates all worlds.\" Look deeply at a flower. It may be tiny, but the sun, the clouds, and everything else in the cosmos penetrates it. Nuclear physicists say very much the same thing: one electron is made by all electrons; one electron is in all electrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second penetration  is, \"All living beings penetrate one body. One body penetrates  all living beings.\" When you kill a living being, you kill yourself and everyone else as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is, \"Infinite time penetrates one second. One second penetrates infinite time.\" A <i>ksana </i>is the shortest period of time, actually much shorter than a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth penetration is, \"All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching.  One teaching penetrates all Buddhist teachings.\" As a young monk, I had the opportunity to learn that Buddhism is made of non-Buddhist elements. So, whenever I study Christianity or Judaism, I find the Buddhist elements in them, and vice versa. I always respect non-Buddhist teachings. All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching,  and one teaching  penetrates all Buddhist teachings. We are free.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth penetration is, \"Innumerable spheres enter one sphere. One sphere enters innumerable spheres.\" A sphere is a geographical  space. Innumerable spheres  penetrate into one particular area, and one particular area enters into innumerable spheres. It means that when you destroy one area, you destroy every area. When you save one area, you save all areas. A student asked me, \"Thay,  there  are so many urgent problems, what should I do?\" I said, \"Take one thing and do it very deeply and carefully, and you will be doing everything at the same time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sixth penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate one organ. One organ penetrates all sense organs\"-eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. To take care of one means to take care of many. To take care of your eyes means to take care of the eyes of innumerable living beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate non-sense  organs. Non-sense  organs penetrate  all sense organs.\"  Not only do non-sense organs penetrate  sense organs, they also penetrate non-sense organs. There  is no discrimination. Sense organs are made of non-sense-organ elements. That is why they penetrate  non-sense  organs. This helps us remember the  teaching of the  <i>Diamond Sutra.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "The eighth penetration  is, \"One perception  penetrates all perceptions. All perceptions penetrate one perception.\" If your perception is not accurate, it will influence all other perceptions  in yourself and others. Suppose a bus driver has an incorrect  perception. We know what may happen. One perception penetrates all perceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  ninth penetration  is, \"Every sound penetrates one sound. One sound penetrates every sound.\" This is a very deep teaching. If we understand  one sound or one word, we can understand all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  tenth penetration is, \"All times penetrate one time. One time penetrates all times-past, present, and future. In one second, you can find the past, present, and future.\" In the past, you can see the present and the future. In the present, you can find the past and future. In the future, you can find the past and present. They \"inter-contain\" each other.  Space contains  time, time contains  space. In the teaching of interpenetration, one determines the other, the other determines this one. When we realize our nature of interbeing, we will stop blaming and killing, because we know that we inter-are. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interpenetration is an important teaching,  but it still suggests that things outside of one another penetrate into each other. Interbeing is a step forward. We are already inside, so we don't have to enter. In contemporary nuclear physics, people talk about implicit order and explicit order. In the explicit order, things exist outside of each otherthe table outside of the flower, the sunshine outside of the cypress tree. In the implicit  order, we see that  they are inside each other-the sunshine  inside the cypress tree. Interbeing is the implicit order. To practice mindfulness and to look deeply into the nature of things is to discover the true nature of interbeing. There we find peace and develop the strength to be in touch with everything. With this understanding, we can easily sustain the work of loving and caring for the Earth and for each other for a long time.\n",

      "\n",
      "All things are interconnected. The nuclear arms race is inextricably linked to other forms of violence and suffering that afflict life on Earth. Recognizing  this, I propose reductions in military spending with corresponding allocations to be used for the alleviation of world hunger. As the strongest nation on Earth, the United States can take the first step with an independent initiative for stopping  the arms race, and this action can be taken regardless of the actions that are taken or not taken by any other country. Let the money that is saved by reductions in defense spending be spent  for jobs and industries that grow, process, and ship food to the starving children of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I address  this  proposal  to the  people  of the  United States, and in particular to my colleagues in the religious and peace communities. Forty thousand children a day and ten million people a year die of starvation. This suffering cannot be alleviated by government action alone. As individuals, we must also assume responsibility and lend our efforts and our hearts to the work of ending human suffering and building human solidarity. For example, if people in Western countries  reduced their consumption  of meat and alcohol by just fifty percent,  the resultant  availability of grain would change the fate of millions of starving people in the developing countries. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the war in Vietnam  we proposed  a cease-fire plan to the Americans. It was the voice of those who were under the bomb. The  proposal was for the Americans to independently declare a cease-fire, and then invite  the other side to respond, promising that if the other responded, the U.S. would set a timetable  for total  withdrawal from Vietnam. The same can be done regarding the manufacture of arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the United  States will independently declare a stop to the arms race, and invite Russia, China,  and all other arms-producing countries to do the same. This could be done for six months,  with or without  reciprocation. Then, if other  countries do reciprocate, the U.S. could take another  step toward complete and general disarmament. In this way, through varying stages, defense spending could  be reduced  while at the same time resources could be redirected to alleviate human suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal is offered for the endorsement of all religious denominations, international peace organizations, and other people and organizations that share in the common cause of disarmament and development. I strongly urge these friends to work to create jobs that nurture  the peace and well-being of humanity in order to offer alternative employment to those engaged in the manufacture and sale of the weapons that, even at this moment, are destroying lives of people all over the world.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a deep forest in the highlands stood an ancient  tree. No one knew how many thousands of years it had lived. Its trunk was so large that the arm spans of eighteen  people could not embrace it; great roots pushed up through  the ground  and spread to a radius of fifty meters. The  earth beneath the tree's shadow was unusually cool. Its bark was as hard as rock; if you pressed a fingernail against it, pain ran through  your finger. Its branches  held tens of thou sands of nests, sheltering  hundreds of thousands of birds, both large and small.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, when the sun rose, the first rays of light were like a conductor's baton, initiating a mighty symphony, the voices of thousands of birds, a symphony  as majestic  as the sun dawning  behind  the summit  of the mountain. All the creatures of the mountain and forest arose, either on two feet or four, slowly, in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the great tree there was one hole large as a grapefruit from Bien Hoa and twelve meters from the ground. In the hole lay a small brown egg. No one could say if a bird had brought  the beautiful egg to the hole. Some thought  the egg had not come from a living bird but had been forged by the sacred air of the forest and the life energy of the great tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty years passed; the egg remained  intact. Some nights, birds would be startled from their sleep by a cloud hovering over the hole and a brilliant light shining there, illuminating an entire  corner  of the forest.  Finally, one night,  under a full moon, the egg opened  and a strange bird was born. The bird was very little; it gave a small chirp in the cold night. The moon was very bright; the stars were very bright. The  tiny bird cried throughout the night. Its cry was neither tragic nor bold; it was a cry of surprise and strangeness. It cried until the sun appeared. The first rays of light opened the symphony; thousands of birds' voices broke forth. From that moment, the little bird cried no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It  grew  quickly. The  nuts  and  grains  mother birds brought to the hole were always plenty. Soon the hole in the tree became too small, and the bird had to find another place, much larger, in which to live. It now knew how to fly; it looked for its own food and gathered sticks of straw to cover the floor of its new nest. Strangely, although the egg had been brown, the bird was as white as snow. When it flew, its wingspan was vast, and it moved slowly and very quietly. Often it flew to faraway places where white waterfalls tumbled  day and night like the majestic  breath  of earth and sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the  bird did not  return  for several  days. When  it returned, it lay in its nest all day and night, thoughtfully and quietly. Its two eyes were very bright; they never lost the look of surprise they had from the beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the ancient forest of Dai Lao, a hermit's small hut stood on the slope of a hill. There a monk had lived for almost fifty years. The bird often flew across Dai Lao forest; from time to time it saw the monk walking slowly down the path to the spring,  holding a water  jug in his hand. One day, smoke gently lingered over the roof of the humble hut and an atmosphere of warmth surrounded the hill. The bird saw two monks together on the path leading from the spring to the hut, speaking as they walked. That night the bird remained in Dai Lao forest. Concealed in the branches of a tree, the bird watched the light of the fire flickering inside the hut, where the two monks conversed through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird flew high, high over the ancient  forest. For several days it flew back and forth in the sky without landing. Below stood the great tree in the ancient forest; below, the creatures of the mountain and forest were concealed by grass, bushes, and trees. Since the day the bird listened to the exchange between the two monks, its bewilderment grew. Where have I come from and where will I go? How many thousands of years will the great tree stand?\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird had heard the two monks speak about Time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Time? Why has Time brought us here, and why will it take us away? The  nut that a bird eats has its own delicious nature. How can I find out the nature of Time? The  bird wanted to pick up a small piece of Time and lie quietly with it in its nest for several days to examine its nature. Even if it took months or years to examine, the bird was willing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird flew high, high over the ancient forest. It was like a round balloon drifting in nothingness. The bird felt its nature was as empty as a balloon's. The emptiness of its nature was the ground of its existence, but it was also the cause of the bird's suffering. \"Time, if I could find you, certainly I could find myself,\" thought the bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several days and nights, the bird came to rest quietly in its nest. It had brought  back a tiny piece of earth from the Dai Lao forest. Deep in thought, it picked up the piece of earth to examine it. The  monk from the Dai Lao forest had said to his friend, \"Time is stilled in Eternity. There Love and Beloved are One. Each blade of grass, each piece of earth, each leaf, is one with that love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bird was still unable to find Time. The small token of earth from the Dai Lao forest revealed nothing. Perhaps the monk had lied to his friend. Time  lies in Love, but where is Love? The bird remembered the splashing water falls  endlessly  tumbling in  the  Northwest Forest. It remembered the days it listened to the sound of the waterfalls from morning to evening. The  bird had imagined itself tumbling like a waterfall.  It  played with the  light shining  on the water, with the waterfall it caressed the pebbles and rocks in the streams. In those moments, the bird felt that it was a waterfall itself, that the sound of endless falling water came from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One noon, flying across the Dai Lao Forest, the bird did not see the hut. The whole forest had burned; only a pile of ashes remained  where the monk's hut had been. In a panic, the bird flew around searching. The  monk was no longer in the forest. \"Where had he gone? Corpses of animals. Corpses of birds. Had the fire consumed the monk? The  bird was bewildered. Time,  what are you? Why do you bring us here and why will you take us away? The monk said, \"Time is stilled in Eternity.\" If that is so, perhaps Love has returned the monk to Itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the bird felt anxious. It flew swiftly back to the ancient forest. Anguished cries of many birds. Explosions. The  ancient  forest, far away, was burning.  Faster, faster still, the bird flew. The fire licked the sky. The fire spread near  the  great  tree.  Hundreds of  thousands of  birds shrieked in fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire approached the great tree. The bird fanned the fire with its wings, hoping to put it out, but the fire burned more fiercely. The bird sped to the spring, dipped its wings in the water, and rushed back to shake the water over the forest. The drops sizzled. It was not enough, not enough. The  bird's entire body soaked in water was not enough to extinguish the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cries of hundreds of thousands of birds. Screams  of young birds without feathers to fly. The fire began to burn the great tree. Why was there  no rain? Why didn't  the downpour that fell endlessly in the Northwest Forest flow like a waterfall? The bird let forth a piercing cry. The cry was tragic and passionate and was suddenly transformed into the rushing sound of a waterfall. All at once, the bird felt the fullness of its existence. Loneliness and emptiness vanished as an illusion. The image of the monk. The image of the sun behind the mountain peak. The image of rushing water falling endlessly through a thousand lifetimes. The cry of the bird was now the full sound of the waterfall. Without anxiety, the bird plunged into the forest fire like a majestic waterfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  next morning was calm. The  marvelous rays of the sun shone, but there was no symphony, no voices of tens of thousands of birds. Portions of the forest were completely burned. The great tree still stood, but more than half of its branches and leaves were charred. Corpses of large birds, corpses of small birds. The morning forest was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  birds still alive called one another, their voices be wildered. They did not know by what grace the clear sky had suddenly poured forth  rain, extinguishing  the forest fire the afternoon before. They  remembered  seeing the bird shaking water from its two wings. They knew it was the white bird from the great tree. They flew everywhere throughout the forest seeking the corpse of the white bird, but they did not find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps  the bird had flown away to live in a different forest. Perhaps  the bird had been killed by the fire. The great  tree, its body covered  with wounds, did not say a word. The birds cocked their heads to the sky and began to build new nests in the wounded  body of the great  tree. Does the great tree miss the child to which sacred mountain air and the life energy  of four  thousand  years had given birth?  Bird, where  have you gone? Listen  to the monk: I believe Time  has returned  the bird to the Love that is the source of all things.\n",

      "A tone poem, a snatch of gentle, celebratory  music. A verse about death, which is really about life. A transmutation of death; the emptying of the veins of death, the letting in of light and air to those fearful spaces. How does one cope with death, when death strikes, repeatedly, senselessly, destroying the young, the noble, the brave, the self giving?  Grief  of course,  a period  of silence,  space  for mourning. Then afterward, a reassertion, acceptance. And finally, if one is lucky, endowed, perceptive, brave with the bravery of an artist and poet, he creates something that faces the cruelty, the horror, and he brings to that welter of blood, vengeance, cruelty, and deceit, a \"sea change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is one of the classic and very nearly crushing ironies of the long war in Vietnam; that we have been the recipient, time and again, of gifts of the spirit, gifts of art, profound understanding, hope communicated,  a definition of our selves that exceeds by far our expectation of ourselves. We have heard time and again, from the \"enemy,\" a stubborn distinction between ourselves as a people, and our leadership. Our people have been endowed (by presumption of the same \"enemy\") with compassion, political acuity, generosity, and goodness of spirit. We were a people saddled for a time with an unfortunate and cruel leadership, which persisted in bloodletting despite the best instinct of the majority. Thus went the reading of our character by our \"enemy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such definitions have a mysterious power of creating what they signify, in a sense at least analogous to the sacramental. One thinks of such \"opinions\" so stubbornly held, so patiently reiterated over so long a period of violence, across such unexampled savagery, perpetuated  by a whole succession of American leaders-one thinks of this, and is simultaneously appalled, exhilarated,  and given hope. Is it possible that out of a persecuted, defamed, all but destroyed people should arise the Suffering Servant of our own oracles; possible that salvation for the heinous, blood-ridden West should once again come from the East-and this, not in times of social normalcy, but across the curtain of blood that we wove and suspended between that people and ourselves, upon which they were stretched and racked, day after day, the people to whom Pascal surely had reference, those \"crucified until the end of time\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "In a universal catastrophe, it is surely presumptuous  to single out one element, one tradition, as having \"suffered more\" than others. Who can measure such things? They stop the heart in its tracks. At the same time, the religious resistance in the U.S. at the time of the Vietnam  War could not help but take into special account, with a special gratitude, the Vietnamese Buddhist movement. Spiritually speaking, we were closest to them. We drew most fully on their tradition-such a stubborn, unwavering, gentle, persistent, resilient strength! It seems to me far from stretching a point (more likely simply making a point) to see in this Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, and his people, a literal living out of the words of Paul the apostle, writing  to his community, \"... fatiguing labors more abundant, imprisonments  more frequent, lashings innumerable, many threats of death  ... forty  lashes less one ... three  times scourged, once I was stoned,  three times I suffered ship wreck; a night and a day I was adrift on the high seas; in frequent  journey on foot, in perils from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles,  in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder ness, in perils on the sea, in perils from false brethren,  in fatigue and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in fastings, often in cold and nakedness.... And apart from these things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, my solicitude for all our communities!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This monk, this suffering servant, who is also a poet, an activist, a teacher, and scholar, suffered a personal loss of the most appalling nature. Young Buddhists were studying at the School of Youth for Social Service, which Nhat Hanh had founded in Saigon early in the '60s. There the students were imbued with the spirit of nonviolent service. On leaving the school, they were to go in groups to help the peasants of the South in whatever way possible-building homes, sowing or harvesting crops, resettling refugees, simple, concrete  projects (we would even say, strikingly evangelical ones). But such a school, in such a time, be came a mortal threat to some of those for whom weapons were the indispensable means of survival or liberation. A period of terrorism  was quickly launched. Students  were killed and maimed in a series of bombings. Finally, one night a horrendous crime unfolded. Five of the students were seized in their dormitories, led to the riverbank nearby and shot. One survived, the others died immediately. \n",
      "\n",
      "The episode was not widely reported in the world. It was merely another bloody stereotyped incident of war, a spurt of gunfire in the night, a cry, blood quickly shed, quickly erased.  But not  forgotten by a monk who was also the friend of the slain. And so after a time, after grief and loss had had their time, came this gift, this meditation of Nhat Hanh, peaceful and serious, theologically profound, hopeful, light, airy of spirit, a paschal death and victory, a pas sage by water from time to timelessness. Written, one may rightfully presume,  by one whose soul already  is com pounded  of these qualities,  since he conveys them with such skill. Indeed, to him the dead are the quick, and violence is by no means the master, by no means speaks the last word, or stops the mouth of the victim, or indeed finally rules, whatever his boast, his bloodstained  and inflated pretentious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ironies implicit in the play are enormous and far of reach. We Americans cross the great waters with our techniques of death, supersonic instruments  of appetite, great eyes and ears and maws, a deranged and decapitated sensory apparatus, to smell out and destroy the least lurking evidence of life, health, hope, tradition, faith, family, to tear out the very taproot of existence, to plow up and sow with salt that culture, thousands of years old, which has unfailingly nurtured  a people. \"Let it come down! Let it all come down!\" is the manic whine of the Machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo, coming  across  those same waters (which  we name consciousness, Styx, death, or primordial creation) comes another sort of craft, peopled with spirits, listening, bantering, remembering, laughing. Their wounds  are healed, their memories lucid. They  recall without rancor the method and moment of their death. If there is some thing new about them, it is a quality at once elusive, feisty, a way of standing within death, fronting it, mocking it gently; perhaps best of all, forgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "These  spirits are as they were before death. And this is the genius of Thich  Nhat Hanh. His dead have the verisimilitude of the living. They are young, they push shadows back instead  of joining them. They  push the dark back, they create  space, they speak up. Very different indeed from the dimwit ghosts of Virgil's underworld;  more like the robustness,  the crudity, of Dante's  people-those  in hell, chiefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet with a difference, which continues to escape my mind. It has something to do with a work of authentic Buddhist art, by a monk, about his people. A quality of inwardness, almost of austerity; a patience that escapes our monitors and timepieces; a serenity, caricatured cruelly in the West as stoicism, before death. Something of the twice born, the resurrected, something one sees more and more rarely in the West; now and again in the faces of the old, in a few children, in the cruel ecstasy of street  violence; a light within, struck and then out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only  here it is a steady flame. It lights  those  bodies, making lamps of them, as they cross the waters in our direction. They  come toward us, and their speech is all of forgiveness, of hope, and joy. Indeed, the play seemed to me a simple act of forgiveness and reconciliation. Are you saying to us, Nhat Hanh,  that the Vietnamese  dead will come back to us who murdered  them? will come, not as ministers of vengeance, but sacramental presences, angels, spirits of new creation?  \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so, with all my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I thank you, Nhat Hanh, monk, medium, necromancer, artist. For your grief, for your long travail, your exile, for the deaf and dumb and uncaring world, for the crucifixion and death of your people. Forgive us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because the monk Thomas  Merton  said it to you, and your play says it to me, I dare to repeat: Alleluia! We shall see his face!\n",

      "At 12:30 a.m. on July 5, 1967, in the village of Binh Phuoc, Gia Dinh Province, a group of strangers abducted five young men, brought  them to the bank of the Saigon River, and shot them. All five were volunteer  workers in the School of Youth for Social Service, a nonviolent organization that sought only to heal the wounds of war and reconstruct  the villages. Their names were Tuan, Tho,  Hy, Lanh, and Dinh. Tuan was a Buddhist novice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four died immediately. The fifth, Dinh, survived, but his clothes were soaked with blood and he lost consciousness. The strangers thought all five were dead, so they left.  Silence on the river. There  are many stars in the sky, but no moon. A small sampan comes gently to the shore. Mai appears. The sampan is large enough to take the four, only four, because the fifth, Dinh, is still alive, and must stay be hind.\n",

      "\n",
      "True or not, we will never know. But if the author  has guaranteed  it, then let us believe him. Listen  to what he has said: \"I remember  when I first picked up my pen to write this play.

I will show you that there is a river, but there is no separation. Don't hesitate: I will row the boat myself. You can join me in rowing too, but let us row slowly, and very, very quietly.\"\n",

      "THO: I don't  care for anybody's respect. When  we were alive, I used to act up a bit now and then to win your re spect,  but  now  that  I'm  dead,  why should  I  bother? Brother Hy, tell me, are you sorry, I mean, are you sorry about being dead?\n",

      "<i>the pink roses, the yellow chrysanthe'lllums, the blue bamboo, the white clouds, the bright moon.</i>\n",

      "<i>(Faint sounds of little waves slapping against the sides of the boat)</i>\n",

      "THO: Wherever Hy goes he brings  music and  poetry along. What was that song? It sounds familiar.\n",

      "MAI: Do you think you understand that song, Tho?\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Sister Mai, now that we're dead, what will we do? Do I have to keep working for the villagers like Vui?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: No, you can do as you please. You can wander around and enjoy yourself. \n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Great! Then  maybe I'll be like Lien. All she does is walk here and there. But you said that she also reads the <i>Heart Sut1·a </i>and gives Vui drawing lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: That's  right, you may do anything you please, just like Lien.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: But why does Vui have to work for the villagers?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: I didn't say she had to. If Vui wants to do that, there is work for her to do. The universe of the dead changes according to your wishes. <i>As </i>I see it, the universe of the living does, too.\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: It is neither Hell nor Heaven, Tho. And it's not as far away from the world of the living as people generally believe\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: For that matter, the world of the living is not far from Heaven and Hell. Wouldn't you agree, Sister Mai? I feel that if I sing now, the living will hear me.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Well, at last we hear from you, Lanh. You've been so quiet. Yes, you are right. The saying \"Yin and Yang are irrevocably separate\" is misleading. A lot of the sorrow that plagues the living comes from their belief that the two worlds are unbridgeable. Indeed, you can sing for the living, as I have many times... as Hy just did. \n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Hy used to be head of the Performing Arts Committee. Tell me, Hy, when we were alive, art was a means for rural redevelopment. We used poetry, painting, music, and theater to help people. How shall we use them now?\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: When we were alive, art was with us. Now, art is still with us. Perhaps we are still alive, in some way. While we were living, we were already dying. How could we have life without death, or, for that matter, death without life?\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: Yes, you only died last night, on the bank of this very river, eight kilometers back. As soon as it happened, I came here with this  boat to get you. Now we are going  upstream, toward the frontier.\n",

      "<i>(A long silence)</i>\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "THO: I wasn't surprised at all when I saw you, Sister Mai. It seemed the most natural thing in the world for you to be there. If you hadn't come, who would have? \n",

      "MAI: It's true, I could never be too busy for all of you.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "LANH:  It's strange. I don't feel any sorrow, pain, or bitter ness. Sister Mai, I thought we would bear those feelings, even after death. The living always tell stories about people who die unjustified deaths. They  talk about the revenge of the dead, and they become deathly afraid. Now I see that the dead are calmer and more lucid than the living. We dead do not think at all about vengeance. We just feel compassion for the living, even for those who killed us.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: If I were alive, I would go to the home of the man who killed me to ask him why he dragged  me to the riverbank in the dead of the night and shot me. But I don't feel any grudge against him, none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY:  Perhaps we dead are more forgiving because we no longer have to bear the heavy burden of our bodies, and their desires and angers. Desire and anger need a home, and now that we no longer have our bodies...\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: But Hy, how can you say that we no longer have our bodies? How could I see you if you didn't have a body? Our bodies are no longer heavy, no longer a burden, that's all. See how small and delicate this boat is, and yet it carries all five of us with ease. \n",
      "\n",
      "THO: You're right! We really are light. The boat carries us and even moves quickly. Tell me, Sister Mai, were you there when they shot us?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI:  No.  But I had a strong sense that  something was wrong, so I came with the boat to get you. When I arrived, the four of you were still sitting  on the riverbank.  Hy's clothes were soaking wet, and he was shaking a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: When  they shot me, I fell into the river. Because my arms were tied behind me, I could only use my feet to try to rise to the surface, but they kept shooting  until I sank completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Oh, Hy...\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Please don't feel sorry for me, Sister Mai. Save it for those still alive. I only had to go through a few seconds, a short minute of pain, that's all. But those close to us, who are still alive, they are the ones who suffer. Even those who killed us. They don't know what they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Tell me, Hy, how did it happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: It was about midnight. Tuan, Lanh, and I were asleep at the Health  Aid Post when a group  of armed  men arrived. They tied our arms behind us and set the Post on fire. The flames made it look as bright as day. Then they took us to the lake near the Tinh Vo Gymnasium and told us to wait. A moment later, two more men arrived with Dinh and Tho. Their arms were also tied behind their backs. Then they took all five of us to the riverbank. We were next to the bamboo grove, supposedly waiting for a boat. Again and again they asked if we were part of the Youth for Social Service, to be absolutely sure. Then, suddenly, they shot us. We four died, but Dinh was only wounded. They thought he was dead too, so they left.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: There were eleven of them. Some were very young, sixteen or seventeen. The  oldest must have been under thirty. Some of them wore black clothes, some wore uni forms. One had a raincoat  and another  a poncho. Some wore military caps and bullet belts. I know who they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: I know who they were, too. You don't have to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: I had the feeling  they were not experienced at the business of killing. They  had to kill us, but I could feel their reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: They obviously had orders from someone. The leader of the group, the one who shot me in the head twice, looked as though  he had to convince himself to pull the trigger. He just didn't have it in him to do it easily. When they arrived at the house of the village medical chief, they immediately tied us together  so we couldn't  run. On the way to the river, we had to jump over two ditches about a meter  wide, and at the second one, Dinh  fell and they helped him up. I asked if they would cut us loose from each other so we could walk more easily, and they did. While we were walking, they talked to us in a very friendly way.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: The men who abducted the three of us behaved the same way. They were very gentle. They let us stop and rest a couple of times. I really thought it wouldn't be too bad. When  Tho  crawled under  barbed wire and cut himself, one man touched  his forehead and asked about  it, as a brother would. Another even patted me on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: And then they killed us.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: What a pity! Men are such pitiful creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Sister Mai, you know I didn't say that with any blame. My eyes are now open. I see clearly now. I only hope that men discover a better way to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: If anyone is tired, you can change your rowing hand. Just change seats with the person next to you. Tho,  why don't you move over there and let Brother Tuan sit here. Good, let's go on. But take it easy, there's no hurry. The stars are so bright. You know, Hy, the eyes of the living have a difficult time seeing the whole of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Isn't there a way to change that?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI <i>(speaking very slowly): </i>Man has progressed some, but so slowly. That  is why, with our present consciousness, time in the living world goes so fast. Tell me, Brothers, before they shot you, did they say anything in particular?\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: They  asked us if we were part of the School  of Youth for Social Service. Then they walked a little ways away and whispered  to each other.  After  that  they approached us again and asked the same question, and then they consulted each other again in whispers. They repeat ed this a few more times, then they asked us, \"Do you have anything to say?\" When  I heard  that,  chills ran up my spine. Tho said we had nothing to say, and the leader touched his forehead and said, very quickly, \"I have to kill you.\" Then  he put his gun to Tho's temple, and fired two shots. The rest of us were shot right after. Hy fell into the river, and was shot until he sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Poor  Hy. Brother Van will be shattered when he hears about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: Yes. All those close to us will feel the loss. There  is one consolation. <i>(He smiles) </i>The  living forget quickly. In just a few months, the pain in their hearts will be soothed. Other worries and sorrows will help them forget.  How could they go on living and working if they did not forget?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Still, I feel sorry for them. Some will record their love and pain on bricks and stones, or on paper with ink, to help themselves remember. But the only important image of the departed is the one that remains in the heart. As far as I am concerned, I pray that all those who were dear to me would forget me quickly so that they will not have to suffer any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: Tho! What are you doing now?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "bound by appearance. Don't you remember, it says in the scriptures, \"It is not possible to recognize the Buddha by his physical appearance?\" Since you were studying to be a fully ordained monk, you should be able to see me in any form. Why must I be only the Tho of twenty-one?\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: Okay! But don't preach to me from the <i>Diamond Sutra. </i>Tho, do you really think that I cannot  transform myself into a little child just as well as you? I am only afraid that if I did, you would be on your knees, begging your old Tuan to come back again.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "TUAN: When I saw they had shot Tho,  I recited the name of Amitabha  Buddha, and right away I was riddled with bullets. I died quickly and felt no pain at all. What  happened to Dinh?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: He  is still  alive, Tuan.  One  bullet  went  through Dinh's arm and lung and punctured  his pancreas. I bent down to look at him. The strangers had already gone, and Dinh was still conscious. He coughed over and over, and each time blood spurted  out.  His shirt  was completely soaked  in blood,  but he will be rescued  in time,  don't worry.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO <i>(thoughtfully):  </i>When he is well again, he will tell our friends what happened. I wonder if he will remember anything to tell.\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: Be calm, Brother. Our country will be destroyed and our people will suffer even more than they already have. The  cycle must be completed. Life and death are in the course of things. In the end there will be peace.\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: You will. Don't expect to understand everything in a single night. I will show you Vui's village. She has many children in her school. Her village also has water buffalo, oxen, rivers, and many trees-banana, lemon, and manda nn.\n",

All the people standing around were weeping, and I wept with them. But when my father arrived, I didn't cry. That was the most difficult moment. Nothing can be more painful than seeing  those dear to you suffer because of what you have done. I left long letters to my parents, ask ing them to understand. But, as you know, letters  don't mean very much.\n",

Even though my eyes have seen our ruined gardens and rice fields, my heart has been set free. I know that peace will come. The wheel is turning in that direction. I've gone through entire areas where the forests have been burned down, charred and black, where the bombs have crushed  the earth and bulldozed  the fields, making craters everywhere. And I've seen crowds of refugees carrying their meager possessions on their backs-babies, cooking pots, a few clothes-their steps undecided, their eyes bewildered.\n",

      "MAI: If you set fire to a piece of charcoal, it burns red and becomes heat. When the fire dies, the charcoal is reduced to ash. Heat is the afterlife of the charcoal. From then on, the heat begins an uninterrupted  process of influences, either in terms of energy or physical properties.

      "MAI: Death is change, a sudden evolution, that's all. If Tho had died when he was eight,  there would not have been any Tho of twenty-one to die just a while ago and to be sit ting here now. Actually, though,  the eight year old Tho had to die, to give way to the twenty-one year old Tho. But the death of the eight-year-old Tho was not sudden. It was a progressive change, a process of growing.\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: That is more  to the  point  than  my explanation, Brother Tuan. That is it, Hy. In order to grow, Tho had to receive support from many other forms of existence-air for his lungs, food for his body, education  for his mind, love for his heart. In Tho,  there are innumerable physical and mental beings-his father and mother, myself, and that girl with ruddy cheeks who will cry this morning over his departure. She should  be sleeping peacefully now in the world of the living.\n",
      "\n",

      "MAI: That's right.  But you are not only present  within them, you are present outside them as well. All you have said and done has already begun its journey. You are pre sent everywhere. \n",

      "MAI: She lives with Vui, leisurely and peacefully, smiling almost all the time. They are practically inseparable. The last time I saw her, she had the whole collection of the <i>Maha  Prajñaparamita  Sutra  </i>in her hand. You know, she is reading the entire collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: If I read the <i>Prajña Sutra  </i>now, I think I would understand it much more easily. There is such peace and calm within my heart.\n",

      "\n",
      "TUAN: When I was alive, not a day passed when I did not recite the <i>Heart Sutra. </i>I thought I understood it. But it was only when the man with the poncho pointed a gun at my head that I really saw what the <i>Heart Sutra </i>was all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Tell us, Brother Tuan, what did you see?\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: It's hard to say, Lanh. It's not something to be un derstood but to be <i>seen. </i>We can easily explain what we un derstand, but not what we see or perceive. It came all of a sudden, like lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH <i>(begging): </i>But try, Brother Tuan, what did you see? TUAN: Well, when that man with the poncho brought his\n",
      "\n",
      "gun up to my head, I realized immediately, without being aware of it consciously, that he was not going to shoot <i>me. </i>He was going to shoot something  else, but not me. How could  he shoot  me without knowing  who I was? Since then, I have been wondering how someone can blow the brains out of another without knowing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "THO: You are funny, Brother Tuan! He asked us over and over again to make sure that we really were the Youth for Social Service, before he killed us. He shot you because he <i>knew </i>who you were. You were a member of the Youth for Social Service. They  wanted to kill the Youth for Social Service. Therefore  they shot you.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Why are you smiling, Sister Mai?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Tho is speaking in terms of logic, and the <i>Heart Sutra </i>is exactly the tool we need to shatter  that kind of reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: I agree with you, Sister Mai. \"Youth for Social Service\" is just a label that they pasted on the objects of their hatred or fear, an object that exists only in their perception. It has nothing to do with us as persons. They shot only at the object of their fear and hatred,  but because they had pasted the label of this object on us, they ended up shooting us, and we died by mistake. They killed us because they truly did not know who we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Brother Tuan, are you speaking about wrong perceptions? Hatred  and fear blind us. We no longer see each other. We see only the faces of monsters, and that gives us the courage to destroy each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: The  war that is raging in our homeland is caused by exactly this blindness. Those who are shooting at this very moment  do not know who they are fighting. All are victims. And some are ready to profit from the mutual destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: That is certainly true of those who killed us. In a fleeting moment, I think they saw that we were just human beings, not monsters. But, when the moment arrived, they\n",
      "\n",
      "had to shoot, to obey orders. It must be the cruel, irrevocable order imposed on man's destiny. \n",
      "\n",
      "THO: Oh, Lanh, you talk as if there were such a thing as an abstract  order. That order came from their superiors,  who else?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: You do not  understand, Tho. The ones who killed you were only obeying  the orders  of their superiors. And those superiors  were also victims. Yet, those who shot you did show their human qualities. They hesitated,  not wanting to kill you, fighting against  themselves. They had to carry out their orders  because they were crushed  between the hammer and the anvil, the orders  and their  families, their  jobs, even their lives. Their consciences  and perceptions had been greatly obscured.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: One man even exclaimed, \"God, you are all so young!\" It was not  just an expression of pity for us, but also a pro test against his own fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Men kill because, on the one hand, they do not know their  real enemy, and on the other  hand,  they are pushed into a position  where they must kill. Let me tell you what happened  to our Brother  Duc last year. He was waiting for a civilian plane at a small isolated airport  in the highlands, along with a young American army officer who was waiting for a caribou plane to fly him on a search-and-destroy operation. There was no one else besides  the two of them. The young American struck up a conversation  with Brother Duc, who immediately saw that the man knew nothing about Vietnamese history or culture or the  truth of the conflict in which he was playing a part. He knew only one thing: the Vietcong were his enemy. His duty, as he put it, was to destroy the Vietcong in order  to save the Vietnamese and the free world. Brother  Duc felt so sad. He asked the GI, \"Are you afraid of Vietcong?\" With  that question the soldier leaped to his feet. Duc saw the alarm and suspi cion in his eyes, fear that Duc himself might be a VC. The GI had been told again and again that the VC were very cunning, and wherever he went, he imagined that the VC were present. So he asked rapidly, putting his hands on his gun, \"Are you a VC?\" Brother Duc thought  the question was funny, but he dared not smile. He knew that if he said, in a joking spirit, \"Yes,\" the soldier would shoot him. So he answered, \"No,\" and explained that he was only a professor of religion waiting to catch a plane back to Saigon. Do you know what our Brother Duc said after he had told us about this incident?  He said that if he had been killed then, it would not have been because the American soldier wanted to kill him. The  soldier only wanted to kill Vietcong. He could hate the VC only because he did not really know what the VC were. He imagined that they were wild, cruel monsters that had to be hunted down. In his country the people are fed so much of this that they keep letting their government send men over here to kill and be killed. So, men kill unjustly and in turn are killed unjustly, and it is their own countrymen  who kill them. They  are the ones responsible for the massacre of our people, but they think they have nothing to do with it because it is not they who hold the guns and pull the triggers. Who is really killing us? It is fear, hatred, and prejudice.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: The world of the living is shrouded in fog. All I feel now is compassion for the destiny of mankind. It is like walking in a moonless, starless night.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Excuse me, but may I change the subject? You know, one of the reasons I am taking you to see Sister Lien is that I want you to see her paintings. I believe that she has really achieved something. In her earthly life she loved art very much, but now she has realized it. I am sure she draws inspiration from the <i>Heart Sutra.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Vui, too, used to love art when she was alive. I suppose they are in accord now. I love painting  myself. Do you think I will understand Sister  Lien's work? Inspiration drawn from the <i>Heart Sutra, </i>that's awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: What wouldn't you be able to understand, Hy? Just a while ago we discussed the <i>Prajñaparamita </i>itself! We each paint our own lives.  If your work is broad and free your life will be broad and free, also. That  is all. We create our own worlds with our visions, conceptions, and thoughts. We might create a constricted world of suffering and sorrow, or one that is immense  and free, a truly  beautiful place. The essential ingredient is a spirit of openness, tolerance, and freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "HY: Now I understand what Brother Tuan meant when he said, \"The mind is like a painter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI <i>(laughs): </i>Yes. Why don't you all begin here and now to paint your own lives. Every artist is capable, through  his art, of reaching the supreme objective of life itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tho: Then my picture, Sister Mai, will probably look like that of Vui. My world must contain a lemon tree! I once threatened Brother Duc  that  if the Pure  Land  has no lemon trees I will refuse to enter! But that's not all. My world will also have coconut trees, moats where the water is clear in the morning,  thatch-roofed schools where at noontime  the children's singing reaches my ears: \"Lam Son Mountains! Lam Son Mountains! Banners flapping in the wind!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Tho, do be quiet!I didn't realize that the dead could be homesick! When  little Thanh of Binh Phuoc Hamlet hears that his teacher has been killed, he will cry until he has no tears left. Yes, our Pure Land must contain those little boys, and friendly meetings in the village where the first event of the program is always, \"Our  headman has a few words to say to you.\" There  must also be those wharfs down by the river where we bathe, where we can swim over to the other side and snatch a few ears of com to roast on an open fire and eat together. It is such a small world, isn't it, Sister Mai?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI  <i>(smiles tolerantly): </i>No, Lanh, it is not a small world. The  strokes of your painting are those of love. Not only scenes of mountains or clouds or immense skies are breath taking. Lonely pines standing on snowy cliffs can also be free and bold. The world of the bodhisattvas also has lakes and ponds, low hills, curved bridges, and red earthen paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH  <i>(mysteriously): </i>And highways.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI: Yes, and highways. Because of love, you draw lemon trees,  fig trees,  bamboo  groves, and river wharfs. The longer the war lasts, the more hatred it creates, and love is being crushed underfoot. We see those dear to us unjustly destroyed and it is hard to keep our hearts peaceful so that love can survive. Using hatred to fight hatred is the surest way to create even more hatred. Those who create love are fewer and fewer, while those who create hate are more and more. And we are changed by it all. Simple, honest, close to-the-earth people, even after the war is over, will go on bearing the deep wounds inflicted by all this hatred. \n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Isn't that the biggest concern? It must be better to be destroyed in a split second and then recreated, than to destroy all faith and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "TUAN: Yes, Lanh, that is our basic concern. I, myself, was born in 1945, the year of the revolution. The last of our family's three boys. As we grew up, all we saw was war and hatred. My hometown, Ben Tre, was where the energy and fervor of the revolution were in constant movement, much like the swift, deep water of the Tien  Giang River on its way to the sea. Fortunately, my family realized early on the necessity of love and encouraged me to follow my inclina tion for a monk's life. I went to the Buddhist Institutes of Giac Sanh, Tra Vinh, and later An Quang. Then I took up social studies and fieldwork. When  I worked hard, it was not because I had any illusion about my ability to change the situation. That  would have been like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a cup of water. But I did have faith then, and I still have faith now, that our work was of value because it sowed seeds of tolerance  and love in people's hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "LANH: Let us hope that our earthly  lives, as well as our deaths, have sown the seeds of tolerance and love. Sister Mai's death, for instance, did not provoke any hatred. On the contrary, it awakened in many people the ability to un derstand and sacrifice, even people far away.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "MAI: Yes. In twenty kilometers, we will leave the boat for the jungle. The  current will be so strong  that it will be impossible for us to continue  to row upstream.\n",

      "\n",
      "THO: Dawn is almost here, friends. Brother Tuan, look up at the great trees, pink in the light of dawn! There is someone standing  there waiting, isn't there? Could it be Lien?\n",
      "\n",
      "MAI <i>(smiles): </i>Of course it's Lien. \"Who else? Let's row a bit harder, come on, let's row.\n",

      "\n",
      "The essence of nonviolence is love. Out of love and the willingness to act selflessly, strategies,  tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise naturally. Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process. Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance, but a non violent one cannot  use such blind sources of energy, for they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself. Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and '70s arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside,  and people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people's survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and maintain the strictest  neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as \"pro-communist  neutralists.\" Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North  Vietnamese spoke for the communist  bloc and the South  Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist  bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a \"victory\" by either side.  During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children raising  their  bare hands against barbed  wire; students confronting military  police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and holding bayonets; young women running  through  clouds of tear gas with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently; monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for independence from the French,  and they won the support  of their countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive resistance and undertake  positive efforts to over come the war and the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue  and Danang learned  that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those cities brought  their family altars-the most sacred objects in their homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition  to oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying they used religion for political  purposes,  but I do not agree. They  were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront  the violence. This was not a political act; it was an act of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fasting, the method used most by Mahatma Gandhi to help India in its struggle for independence,  was also used in Vietnam. Sometimes,  thousands of people fasted, and other times, a single person fasted. We fasted as prayer to purify our hearts, consolidate our will, and arouse awareness and compassion in others. When Thich Tri Quang fasted for 100 days, those who passed the Duy Tan Clinic were jarred into awareness, and compassion was born in them. As a result, they felt compelled  to meet, talk, and plan, thereby escalating the struggle. Thich Tri Quang had not <i>planned </i>to fast. He <i>had </i>to fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also used literature and the arts as \"weapons\" to challenge the oppression. Works by antiwar writers, composers, poets, and artists, although illegal, were widely circulated. Antiwar songs were sung in streets and classrooms, and antiwar literature became the largest category of books sold in Vietnam, even infiltrating army units. <i>Look Back at Your Homeland, Only Death Allows You to Speak Out, </i>and <i>Lotus in a Sea of Fire </i>sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Our literature was considered  dangerous  by both sides. One book of poems, <i>Let Us Pray so the White Dove Will Be with Us, </i>was submitted to the Ministry of Information, and only two of the sixty poems in it were approved. A group of students published it anyway, and within a week, all copies were sold. In Hue, a policeman saw a copy in a bookstore and warned the owner, \"Hide  this and only bring it out when someone asks for it.\" Sister Cao Ngoc Phuong was arrested  in Hue for transporting antiwar books, and, before I left the country, I was also arrested and imprisoned for a few days in Bao Loc for \"antiwar\" activities, although I was charged only with the crime of listening  to Hanoi Radio.  Folk poetry was used as means of education. This lullaby was sung throughout the country:\n",

      "During the superpower confrontation in Vietnam, while thousands and thousands of peasants  and children lost their lives, our land was unmercifully ravaged. Yet we were unable to stop the fighting; we were not able to make ourselves heard or understood. We had little access to the international news media. People thought we Buddhists were trying to seize power, but we had no interest in power. We only wanted to stop the slaughter. The voice of the Viet namese people-8O percent  Buddhists-was lost in the melee of shooting and bombs. But we realized  that the means and the end are one, and we never employed any kind of action  that  betrayed  our commitment to nonviolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1963, Venerable Thich Quang Duc went to the cross\n",
      "\n",
      "roads of Phan  Dinh  Phung,  sat in the  lotus  position, poured gasoline on himself, and transformed himself into a torch. His disciple read his last words to the press. Madame Nhu described it as a \"barbecue.\" By burning himself, Thich  Quang Duc awakened the world to the suffering of the war and the persecution of the Buddhists. When someone stands up to violence in such a courageous way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc's act expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way, including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be \"a torch in the dark night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She left behind letters to the Presidents  of North  and South Vietnam, imploring  them to stop the fighting.  She wrote one letter to me: \"Thay, don't worry too much. We will have peace soon.\" Nhat Chi Mai moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the hearts of the oppressors and call the world's attention  to the suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination,  courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots on his body with <i>moxa </i>incense as he takes the 2<i>50 </i>vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to helping living beings. If he were to say this while sitting comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered  while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing  this kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Vietnamese   monks,  nuns,  and  laypeople  who burned themselves were saying with all their strength and determination that they were willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy,  but to create.  Suicide  is an act of self-destruction based on the inability to cope with life's difficulties. In Buddhism, self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions  of the precepts. Those  who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance,  fanaticism, oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that  lay within the hearts of their fellow men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself. Then  everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence. Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors and students followed suit. There  were labor strikes at the harbors and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and university students  boycotted  classes and examinations. Draftees refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals. The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas, grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these nonviolent efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement, damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned  or killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians, workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously wounded-all  because they refused to take sides in the war. In a memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and neutrality: \"Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways of working for the people of Vietnam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite  the  results-many years of war followed  by years of oppression and human rights abuse-1 cannot say that our struggle was a failure. The conditions for success in terms of a political victory were not present. But the success of a nonviolent struggle can be measured only in terms of the love and nonviolence attained, not whether a political victory was achieved. In our struggle in Vietnam, we did our best to remain true to our principles. We never lost sight that the essence of our struggle was love itself, and that was a real contribution to humanity.\n",

      "\n",
      "Just this morning, the U.S. Consulate in Hue was destroyed by angry Vietnamese youths. In the past four days, five Vietnamese have immolated themselves, some of them leaving behind messages explaining that their actions were in protest against U.S. policy in South Vietnam. During my short visit to your country,  I have repeatedly been asked why the Vietnamese people seem to have become so strongly anti-American.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish, first  of all, to assure you that  I am not  anti American. Indeed, it is precisely because I do have a great respect and admiration for America that I have undertaken this long voyage to your country,  a voyage that entails great personal risk for me upon my return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this risk willingly because I have faith that if the American public can begin to understand some thing of what the Vietnamese  people feel about what is happening in our country, much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery being endured by both our peoples might be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demonstrations, self-immolations, and protests that we are witnessing in Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frustrations that the Vietnamese people feel at being so effectively excluded from participation in the determination of their country's future. Eighty years of French domination over Vietnam were ended by a long and bloody struggle waged and won by the Vietnamese people against overwhelming odds. During the twelve years since independence, most Vietnamese have remained without a voice in the nation's destiny, and this at a time when the nation is being subjected to a destructive force far surpassing anything ever before seen in our country. If anti-Americanism seems to be emerging  as a focus for some of the recent protests,  it is because the Vietnamese people recognize that it is really only the awesome U.S. power that enables the Saigon governments to rule without a popular mandate and to follow policies contrary  to the aspirations of the Vietnamese  people. This  is not  the independence for which the Vietnamese people fought so valiantly.\n",

The  most effective Vietcong propaganda says that the Saigon governments are mere puppets of the U.S., corrupt lackeys of the imperialists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every escalation  of the war, every new contingent of U.S. troops confirms these charges and wins new recruits to the Vietcong,  for the overwhelming  majority  of the Vietnamese people now thirst desperately for peace and oppose any further expansion of the war. They see clearly that the present  policy of constant  escalation only puts peace ever further into the future and merely guarantees an even greater destruction of Vietnamese society. There  are now more than 300,000 Americans in my country, most of them knowing and caring little about our customs and practices and many of them involved in destroying Vietnamese people and property.\n",
      "\n",
      "This  creates friction  which generously  feeds the anti American propaganda,  and the fact that the war kills far more innocent  peasants than it does Vietcong is a tragic reality of life in the Vietnamese countryside. Those  who escape death by bombings must often abandon  their destroyed villages and seek shelter  in refugee camps where life is even more miserable than it was in the villages. In general, these people do not blame the Vietcong for their plight. It is the men in the planes, who drop death and destruction  from the skies, who appear to them to be their enemies. How can they see it otherwise?\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States chooses to support those elements in Vietnam that appear to be most devoted to the U.S.'s wishes for Vietnam's future. But these elements have never been viewed by the Vietnamese people as their spokesmen. Diem was not, nor were Diem's successors. Thus,  it has been the U.S.'s antipathy to popular government in South Vietnam, together  with its hope for an ultimate  military solution, that has not only contradicted the deepest aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but actually undermined the very objective for which we believe Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "To us, America's first objective is to have an anticommunist, or at least a non-communist, Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese people's objective is to have peace. They dislike communism, but they dislike war even more, especially after twenty years of fighting and bitterness which has rotted the very fabric of Vietnamese life. Equally important, we now see clearly that continuance of the war is more likely to spread communism in Vietnam than to contain it. The new social class of military officers and <i>commerfants </i>that has been created as a direct result of the U.S. involvement, a class of sycophants who support the war for crass economic reasons, are not the people to whom Washington should listen if it sincerely wishes to hear the voice of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people reject with scorn this corrupt  and self-seeking class that cares neither  for Vietnam nor for the great ideals of America, but thinks only of its own interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opinion is often expressed that there is no alternative to the present U.S. policy in Vietnam, neither on the political nor the military side. The non-communist alternatives to a military dictatorship  are said to be too fragmented  to offer a stable alternative, and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal  are considered  unfeasible  because it is feared that the Vietcong will take over the country by terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vietnamese people recognize both of these dangers, but they also recognize  the utter  futility  of the present course and the catastrophic effects that it is having on our society. Furthermore, we do not agree that there is no alternative to a military dictatorship. The force of Vietnamese nationalism is such an alternative. Indeed, this is the sole force that can prevent the complete disintegration  of South Vietnam, and it is the force around which all Vietnamese can unite. But nationalism cannot attain its effective potential in the present Vietnamese political climate, where opposition to the government invites open persecution upon oneself and identification with it discredits one in the eyes of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "More  than a decade of this atmosphere has served to drive many of the Vietnamese nationalists into the National Liberation Front, and many others of them into an ominous silence. Last year, an effort by a prominent group of nationalists  to circulate a mild petition  requesting  peace negotiations  between the South Vietnamese government and the NLF was so brutally attacked by the government that we are not likely to hear from them soon again, de spite their having attained some 5,000 signers in less than three days' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the means for nationalist expression rests mainly with the Vietnamese Buddhists, who alone command sufficient popular support  to spearhead a protest for popular government. This  is not a new role for Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the Vietnamese  peasants, Buddhism and nationalism are inseparably entwined. The historic accident that made the popularization of Christianity in Vietnam coincident with France subjugation of Vietnam created this image.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repression of our faith by the French and by President Diem strengthened it. And today, when the Buddhist attempt  to give expression to the long pent-up wishes of the submerged and ignored Vietnamese masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the Vietnamese army, the Vietnamese people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly see whose action reflects our national heritage and whose action betrays this heritage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, although  the Vietnamese  people may lose skirmishes because they have no foreign sources of support, the crude victories of the Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their credibility while confirming the Vietcong's propaganda claim that the government cares nothing about the people. The Buddhist efforts are designed not to weaken Vietnam's resistance but to create a genuine will to resist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differences do exist among the Buddhists, the Catholics, and the other sects, but they would not be insurmountable if there were a climate in Vietnam that encouraged unity. But there are those who see a unified, popular, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a threat to themselves. Such persons help to sow disunity and then use the disunity which they create as a pretext for retaining power. No, we do not accept the evaluation  that there is no alternative to the present type of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second argument offered for continuing the present U.S. policy is that a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal would merely leave Vietnam to the communists. This argument we must also reject. The Vietcong grow stronger  because of the mistakes made by Saigon, not because of its communist ideology or its terror. If South Vietnam could achieve a government clearly responsive to the basic aspirations of the Vietnamese people and truly independent, there would no longer be any basis for popular support for the rebels. Indeed,  the rebels would have lost their reason to rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to continue, the Vietnamese people would have the will to resist it, for they could identify it as being hostile to Vietnamese nationalism, contrary to the people's longing for peace and reconstruction, and therefore of foreign inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam. Although  I am not a politician  and cannot therefore suggest every detail of a satisfactory settlement, the general direction that such a solution must take is quite clear to me and to many of the Vietnamese people. It does not involve the U.S. in any negotiations  with Hanoi, Peking, or the NLF. To the Vietnamese people, such talks, if necessary, are the proper province of Vietnamese officials rather than of Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "My solution would be along the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>1. A cessation of the bombing, north and south.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>2. Limitation of all military operations by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces to defensive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Vietcong respond in kind.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal actually beginning to take place as a sign of sin cerity.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>4. A clear statement  by the U.S. of its desire to help the Vietnamese  people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to implement  this statement, such as a refusal to support one group over another.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "<i>5. A generous effort to help rebuild, in light of the destruction that has been wreaked upon Vietnam, such aid to be completely free of ideological and political strings and therefore not viewed as an affront to Vietnamese independence.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a program, if implemented with sufficient vigor to convince  the now understandably skeptical Vietnamese people of its sincerity, offers the best hope for uniting them in a constructive effort and for restoring stability to South Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is not perfect, for the question remains of how the U.S. can be sure that the South Vietnamese government and the Vietcong would cooperate in such a venture. Insofar as the South Vietnamese government is concerned, the past statements  of Premier  Ky have clearly indicated his unwillingness to seek a peaceful end to the war. In fact, it has been the contradiction between the aggressive words of Saigon and the peaceful statements of Washington that has so discredited the so-called U.S. peace offensive of last winter. The  withdrawal of the U.S. support  for Ky may thus be a necessary precondition for implementation of such a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is obviously not possible to predict the response of the Vietcong to such a program, but the installation of a popular government in South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the beginning of an American withdrawal, would so undercut the Vietcong's position that it is likely to have no alternative but to cooperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace. To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns. America's history suggests that she has the potential  to provide the world this leadership.\n",

      "\n",
      "In Vietnam, we take great risks publishing antiwar poems. Buddhists who have protested the war have been arrested and exiled, and are now being killed in Danang. Because of this great risk, the Buddhists who demonstrated this Spring were reluctant to advocate openly an end to the war through negotiations; instead, they called for elections and democracy. We are in an impossible dilemma. If we openly call for peace, we are identified with the communists and the government will try to suppress us. If we criticize the communists, we find ourselves aligned with those Vietnamese who have been propagandists  for the Americans for years and whose words against communism are soiled and discredited because they have been paid to say them. To be honorably anticommunist has been to remain silent, and, being silent, we have been labeled as innocent of the dangers of communism. But we are not. We are well aware of the restrictions on Buddhism in the North. We have studied  what happened  in China.  We know there  is no place for spirituality in Marxism. We are ready to under take a peaceful political struggle with the communists, if only the destruction of the war can be stopped. We are confident  that the South .Vietnamese can protect  themselves from communist  domination  if we are allowed to carry out our political lives in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  tragedy of American policy is that it has made such a peaceful political struggle very difficult. The Americans could have helped in reconstructing the country peacefully if they had cooperated with and strengthened the Buddhists and others who had the respect of the people. Instead, they have tried to divide the Buddhists to prevent them from becoming an organized force, and this has been disastrous. Catholicism came to Vietnam with the French, and the Catholic leaders, backed by the U.S., were objects of suspicion for most of the people. The Buddhist tradition is closely linked with nationalism, and it is unthinkable to the broad mass of people that the Buddhists would betray them to a foreign  power. At the same time, Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic in character-there are Catholic priests who are closer to us on the question of peace than some of the older, more conservative Buddhist priests. (A few months  ago, eleven Catholic  priests issued a strong statement calling for peace, and they were attacked by the Catholic leaders.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the U.S. has become too afraid of the communists to allow a peaceful confrontation with them to take place, and when you are afraid, you cannot win. Sending 300,000\n",
      "\n",
      "American troops to Vietnam and bombing the countryside have only caused the communists to grow stronger. American military operations have killed and wounded more innocent peasants than Vietcong, and the Americans are blamed and hated for this. The peasants are not violently antagonistic to the Vietcong. The strong anticommunists are mostly people in the cities who fear the loss of their property, cars, businesses, and homes, and rely on the foreign army to protect them. The American soldiers, moreover, do not understand the Vietnamese. GIs make thousands of small mistakes every day that offend Vietnamese people. And the continual roaring overhead of U.S. planes on their way to drop bombs makes the people sick and angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it is understandable that the villagers distrust those who are connected with the South Vietnamese government and the Americans. Along with others, I helped organize a Buddhist School of Youth for Social Service, and we have trained thousands of young people to work at community development projects in the villages. We refuse to accept money from the government or the American Military Assistance Group. We go into the villages with nothing but our own robes, and we are warmly welcomed. The  peasants we work with tell us that the government officials assigned to \"assist\" them keep thousands of piasters a month for themselves and do nothing for them. They have come to dislike the Vietcong and fear the Americans, whose bombs continue to fall down on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the U.S. wants to escalate the war, we Vietnamese cannot stop you. Even changes of government will make no difference. The war will go on. Venerable Thich Tri Quang believes we may attain peace indirectly by means of political maneuvering and through elections. He is a man of action, courage, and intelligence, whose life is exemplary. But other Buddhists are trying to create a new Buddhist path emphasizing ways of helping the people who live on the land. I myself doubt that much will be gained by indirect political maneuvering against the government and the Catholics, as long as the U.S. is determined to continue the war. Underlying  our struggles with the government  in Danang and other cities is the unstated question of whether the war will go on, and this only the U.S. can decide. I believe the most effective thing we can do is advocate peace, however dangerous that may be, by telling the world that we do not accept this war, that the communists are growing stronger every day it continues to be fought,  and that a cease-fire  must be arranged  with the Vietcong as soon as possible. Then we would welcome the help of Americans in the peaceful reconstruction of our country. Only America has the capability of stopping this war, which is destroying not only our lives, but our culture and everything of human value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  poems that follow are not typical of my own poetry or of Vietnamese poetry generally. The tradition of poetry in Vietnam is very old and complex. It draws on early Chinese poetry, on the French Romantic and symbolist poets of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and, in my own case, on Zen Buddhist writers. Much of my poetry could be called \"philosophical,\" and friends  have found  it in some ways similar to the work of Tagore; at least, it is extremely difficult to translate into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these poems are different. They are popular poems\n",
      "\n",
      "in free verse, and when I write them I am trying to speak very simply for the majority of Vietnamese, who are peas ants and cannot speak for themselves. They do not know or care much about words like \"communism\" or \"democracy,\" but only want the war to end so they can survive. I wrote these poems first for myself; when I read them I can regain the state of intense  feeling in which I composed them. They have now been read and heard by many Vietnamese;  and they have been denounced by both  sides fighting in the war. A few days after they were published last year, government police came to seize them from the bookstores, but by then they had all been sold. They were attacked by the Hanoi radio and the radio of the National Liberation Front. They have been read many times in public along with the peace poems of other  Buddhists, and they have been sung with guitar accompaniment at student meetings, much as songs of protest are sung in the United States.\n",

      "<title>Ahimsa: The Path of Harmlessness</title>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sanskrit word <i>ahimsa, </i>usually translated  \"nonviolence,\" literally means \"non-harming\" or \"harmlessness.\" To practice ahimsa, first of all we have to practice it within ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going in the direction  of non violence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even soldiers. Some army generals, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid killing innocent people; this is a kind of nonviolence. To help soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with them. If we divide reality into two camps-the violent and the nonviolent-and stand in one camp while attacking  the other,  the world will never have peace. We will always blame and condemn those we feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without recognizing  the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on ourselves and also work with those we condemn if we want to have a real impact. It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as enemies, even  those  who act violently. We have  to approach  them  with love in our  hearts  and do our  best to help them move in a direction  of nonviolence. If we work for peace out of anger, we will never succeed. Peace is not an end.  It can never  come  about  through non-peaceful means. When  we protest against a war, we may assume that we are a peaceful  person,  a representative of peace,  but this might  not be the case. If we look deeply, we will observe that  the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have been living. We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves  and others, therefore we are co-responsible: \"Because I have been like this, they are like that.\" A more holistic approach  is the way of \"interbeing\": \"This  is like this, because that is like that.\" This  is the way of understanding and love. With  this insight, we can see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go to a demonstration and say, \"This war is unjust, destructive,  and not worthy of our great nation.\" This is far more effective than angrily condemning others. Anger always accelerates the damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know how to write strong  letters  of protest,  but we must also learn  to write love letters  to our President  and Representatives, demonstrating the kind of understanding and using the kind of language  they will appreciate. If we don't, our letters may end up in the trash and help no one. To love is to understand. We cannot express love to someone unless we understand him or her. If we do not understand our President  or Congressperson, we cannot write him or her a love letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "People are happy to read a good letter in which we share our insights  and our understanding. When  they receive that kind of letter, they feel understood and they will pay attention to your recommendations. You may think that the way to change the world is to elect a new President, but a government is only a reflection of society, which is a reflection of our own consciousness. To create fundamental change, we, the members of society, have to transform ourselves. If we want real peace, we have to demonstrate our love and understanding so that those responsible for making decisions can learn from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry and frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is capable of understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there is a bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara who has 1,000 arms and 1,000 hands, and has an eye in the palm of each hand. One thousand hands represent action, and the eye in each hand represents understanding.  When you understand  a situation  or a person, any action you do will help and will not cause more suffering. When  you have an eye in your hand, you will know how to practice true nonviolence.\n",

      "Imagine if each of our words also had an eye in it. It is\n",
      "\n",
      "easy to depict a hand with an eye, but how might an artist also put an eye into our words? Before we say something, we have to understand what we are saying and the person to whom our words are directed. With  the eye of understanding, we will not say things to make the other person suffer. Blaming and arguing are forms of violence. When we speak, if we suffer greatly, our words may be bitter, and that will not help anyone. We have to learn to calm our selves and become a flower before we speak. This is \"the art of loving speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Listening is also a deep practice. The  bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara has a deep talent for listening. In Chinese, his name means \"listening to the cries of the world.\" We have to listen in a way that we understand the suffering of others. We have to empty ourselves and leave space so we can listen well. If we breathe in and out to refresh and empty ourselves, we will be able to sit still and listen to the person who is suffering. When she is suffering, she needs someone to listen attentively without judging or reacting. If she cannot find someone in her family, she may go to a psychotherapist. Just by listening deeply, we already alleviate a great  deal of her pain. This  is an important practice  of peace. We have to listen in our families and in our communities. We have to listen to everyone, especially those we consider our enemies. When we show our capacity of listening and understanding, the other person will also listen to us, and we will have a chance to tell him of our pain. This is the beginning of healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking is at the base of everything. It is important for us to put an eye of awareness into each of our thoughts. Without a correct understanding of a situation or a person, our thoughts can be misleading and create confusion, de spair, anger, or hatred. Our most important task is to de velop correct insight. If we see deeply into the nature of interbeing, that all things \"inter-are,\" we will stop blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with everyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "These  are the three domains of action-body, speech, and mind. In addition, there is <i>non-action, </i>which is often more important than action. Without our doing anything, things can sometimes go more smoothly  just because of our peaceful presence. In a small boat when a storm comes, if one person remains solid and calm, others will not panic, and the boat is more likely to stay afloat. In many circumstances, non-action can help a lot. A tree merely breathes, waves its leaves and branches, and tries to stay fresh. But if the tree were not there, we could not be here. The  tree's non-action is fundamental to our welbeing. If we can learn to live the way a tree does-staying fresh and solid, peaceful and calm-even if we do not do many things, others will benefit from our non-action, our presence. We can also practice non-action  in the domain of speech. Words can create understanding and mutual acceptance, or they can cause others to suffer. Sometimes it is best not to say anything. This is a book on nonviolent social action, but we must also discuss nonviolent  non-action. If we really want to help the world, the practice of non-action is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, sometimes non-action can be harmful. When someone needs our help and we refuse, she may die. If a monk, for example, sees a woman drowning and does not want to touch her because of his precepts, he will violate the most fundamental principle of life. When we see social injustice, if we practice non-action, we may cause harm. When people need us to say or do something, if we don't, we can kill by our inaction or our silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "To practice ahimsa, we must first of all learn ways to deal peacefully with ourselves. If we create true harmony within ourselves, we will know how to deal with family, friends, and associates. Techniques  are always secondary. Most important is to become ahimsa, so that when a situation  presents itself, we will not create  more suffering. To practice ahimsa, we need gentleness, loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity directed to our  bodies, our  feelings, and other  people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real peace must be based on insight and understanding, and  for this we must  practice deep  reflection-looking deeply into each act and each thought  of our daily lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "With  mindfulness-the practice of peace-we can begin by working  to transform the wars in ourselves. There are techniques  for doing this. Conscious  breathing is one. Every time we feel upset, we can stop what we are doing, refrain from saying anything,  and breathe in and out several times, aware of each in-breath and each out-breath. If we are still upset, we can go for walking meditation, mindful of each slow step and each breath  we take. By cultivating peace within,  we bring about  peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in ourselves is to minimize the numbers of wars between this and that feeling, or this and that perception, and we can then have real peace with others as well, including  the members of our own family.\n",

      "I am often  asked, \"What if you are practicing love and\n",
      "\n",
      "patience  and someone  breaks into your house and tries to kidnap your daughter or kill your husband?  What should you do? Should  you shoot  that person or act in a nonviolent way?\" The  answer depends  on your state of being. If you are prepared, you may react calmly and intelligently, in the most nonviolent  way possible. But to be ready to react with intelligence  and nonviolence, you have to train yourself in advance. It may take ten years, or longer. If you wait until  the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too late. A this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial moment, even if you know that nonviolence  is better than violence, if your understanding is only intellectual and not in your whole being, you will not act nonviolently. The fear and anger  in you will prevent you from acting in the most nonviolent  way.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent war, to prevent the next crisis, we must begin\n",
      "\n",
      "right  now. When a war or a crisis has begun,  it is already too late. If we and our children practice ahimsa in our daily lives, if we learn how to plant seeds of peace and reconciliation in our own hearts and minds, we will begin to establish real peace and, in that way, we may be able to prevent the next war. If another war does come, we will know that we have done our best. Is ten years enough  time to prepare ourselves and our nation to avoid another  war? How much time does it take to breathe consciously, to smile, and to be fully present in each moment?  Our real enemy is forgetfulness. If we nourish mindfulness every day and water  the seeds of peace in ourselves and those around  us, we have a good chance to prevent the next war and to defuse the next crisis.\n",

      "Immediately after ordering the ground attack on Iraq, in February 1991, President  Bush addressed his nation, saying, \"Whatever you are doing at this moment, please stop and pray for our soldiers in the Gulf. God Bless the United States  of America.\"  I suspect  that at the same moment many Moslems were also praying to their God to protect Iraq and the Iraqi soldiers. How could God know which nation to support? Many people pray to God because they want God  to fulfill some of their needs. If they want to have a picnic, they may ask God for a clear, sunny day. At the same time, farmers who need more rain might pray for the opposite. If the weather is clear, the picknickers may say, \"God is on our side; he answered our prayers.\" But if it rains, the farmers will say that God heard  <i>their  </i>prayers. This is the way we usually pray.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught, <i>\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\" </i>Those who work for peace must have a peaceful  heart. When you have a peaceful heart, you are the child of God. But many who work for peace are not at peace. They still have anger and frustration, and their work is not really peaceful. We cannot say that they belong to the Kingdom of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "To preserve peace, our hearts must be at peace with the world, with our brothers and our sisters. When we try. To overcome evil with evil, we are not working for peace. If you say, \"Saddam Hussein is evil. We have to prevent him from continuing  to be evil,\" and if you then use the same means he has been using, you are exactly like him. Trying to overcome evil with evil is not the way to make peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus also said, <i>\"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ... whosoever shall say, 'Thou fool,’ shalt be in danger of hell fire.\"</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesus did not say that if you are angry with your brother, you will be put in a place called hell. He said that if you are angry with your brother, you are already in hell. Anger <i>is </i>hell. He also said that you don't need to kill with your body to be put in jail. You need only to kill in your mind and you are already there.\n",

      "In the Persian  Gulf, many people practiced  killing in their minds-Iraqi, American, French, British, and other soldiers. They knew that if they didn't kill, the enemy sol diers would kill them, so they used sandbags to represent their enemy, and holding their bayonets firmly, they ran, shouted, and plunged  the  bayonets  into  the sandbags. They  practiced killing day and night in their hearts and minds. The damage caused by that kind of practice is huge. I happened to see a few seconds of that kind of practice on TV. Even if President Bush had not given the order for a land offensive, a lot of damage was already being done in the minds and hearts of one million people in the Gulf. Those kinds of wounds last for a long time and are transmitted  to future generations. If you train yourself every day to kill during the day and then dream of killing during the night because you have spent so much time concentrating on that, the damage is deep. If you survive, you will bear that kind of scar for many years. This is a real tragedy. We usually count  bodies to measure the damage from a war, but we don't count these kinds of wounds in the hearts and minds of so many soldiers. We have to see the real long-term damage that war causes. Soldiers live in hell day and night, even before they go into the battlefield, and even after they return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may think of peace as the absence of war, that if the great powers would reduce their weapons arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we will see our own minds-our own prejudices, fears, and ignorance.  Even if we transport all the  bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of the bombs are still here-in our hearts and minds-and, sooner or later, we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To start a war and give the opportunity to one million men and women to practice killing day and night in their hearts is to plant many, many seeds of war-anger, frustration, and the fear of being killed. I felt very sad when I learned that more than eighty percent of the American people supported the Gulf War.\n",

      "<i>\"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

      "This is Jesus' teaching about revenge. \"When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When he wants to borrow something from you, lend it to him. How many Christians actually practice this? There  is a story about an American soldier who was taking a Japanese prisoner during World War II. While walking together, the American discovered that the Japanese soldier spoke English and that he had been a Christian before he abandoned his faith. So he asked, \"Why did you abandon Christianity? It is an excellent religion,\" and the Japanese man said, \"I could not become a soldier and continue  to be a Christian. I don't think a good Christian  can become a soldier and kill another person.\" He understood this passage from Matthew. There  must be ways to solve our conflicts without having to resort to killing. We must focus our attention  on this. We have to find ways to help people get out of difficult situations, situations of conflict, without having to kill.\n",

      "<i>\"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them  that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "This is nondiscrimination. When you pray only for your own picnic and not for the farmers who need the rain, you are doing the opposite  of what Jesus taught. Jesus said, \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you...\" When we look deeply into our anger, we see that the person we call our enemy is also suffering. As soon as we see that, we have the capacity of accepting and having compassion for him. Jesus called this \"loving your enemy.\" When we are able to love our enemy, he or she is no longer our enemy. The  idea of \"enemy\" vanishes and is replaced by the no tion of someone suffering a great deal who needs our com passion. Doing  this is sometimes  easier than we might think, but we need to practice. If we read the Bible but don't practice, it will not help much.\n",

      "<i>\"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.</i>\" Everyone makes mistakes. If we are mindful, we see that  some  of our  actions  in the  past may have caused others to suffer, and some actions of others  have made us suffer. We want to be forgiving. We want to begin anew. \"You, my brother or sister, have wronged me in the past. I now understand that it was because you were suffering and did not see clearly. I no longer feel anger towards you.\" That  kind of forgiveness is the fruit of awareness. When you are mindful you can see all the causes that led the other person to make you suffer. When you see this, forgiveness  and release arise naturally. You can't  force yourself to forgive. Only when you understand  what has happened can you have compassion for the other  person and forgive him or her.\n",

      "If President  Bush had had more understanding of the mind of President Hussein,  peace might have been obtained. President Gorbachev made a number of proposals that could have been acceptable  to the allies, and many lives could have been spared. But because anger was there, Mr. Bush rejected  Mr. Gorbachev's  proposals,  and Mr. Hussein gave the order to burn Kuwaiti oil wells. If President Bush had seen clearly the suffering of the Iraqi people, he would not have allowed his anger to be expressed by starting a war. He asked the American people to pray for the allied soldiers. He asked God to bless the United States of America. He did not say that we should pray for the civilians in Iraq  or even the people  of Kuwait. He wanted God to be on the side of America.\n",

      "Eighty percent of the American people called the Persian Gulf War a victory-only a few hundred  American soldiers were killed. But every human life is precious, and the loss of the 100,000 or more Iraqi people was a great tragedy! You may identify yourself as an American, but that is only partially true. You are more than that. You may have lost just a few hundred American lives, but you also suffered from the Gulf War in many other ways. The deaths of so many Iraqi soldiers and civilians are also casualties that America suffered,  because their death was your country's work. When President Bush said, \"God bless the United States of America,\" he was not paying enough attention to the lives of non-Americans. To those of us who are not American, this was not a good image of America. It was selfish and arrogant, and this was also a casualty that America suffered-not just by guns and bombs, but by your President's statement. If the President had said, \"God bless us so that the war will end soon and that Americans as well as Iraqis will suffer as little as possible,\" he could have won a lot more sympathy from people around the world. But he did not say that.\n",

      "Who is President Bush? President Bush is us. We are responsible  for the way he feels, for everything he does. Eighty percent of the people in America supported him in this just war. Why blame him? Our capacity of loving and understanding was so limited. We were  not  peaceful enough in our own hearts, and we were not able to bring peace to the hearts of other people. When I saw how we prepared for war and practiced killing day and night in our hearts and minds, I felt overwhelmed.\n",

      "After the parades ended and the yellow ribbons were no longer there, what did we have? What did the wives, husbands, children, brothers, and sisters of the soldiers receive when their  loved ones returned from the Gulf after so much fear, hatred, and killing-in reality and in their daily practice? We cannot imagine the long-term effects of watering so many seeds of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please sit still, breathe, and look deeply, and you will see the real losses, the real casualties that America suffered and continues to suffer from the Gulf War. Visualize 500,000 allied soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia, waiting for the order to invade Iraq, jumping and screaming as they plunge their bayonets into sandbags that represent Iraqi soldiers. You cannot plunge a bayonet into a person without first transforming yourself into a beast. On the other side, one million Iraqi soldiers were practicing the same. One and a half million solders were practicing violence, hatred, and fear, and the American public supported  them to do so. They thought that this war was somehow clean, quick, and moral. They saw only bridges and buildings  being destroyed, but the real casualties were the souls of the men and women who came home after practicing violence for so many months.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could they do that and remain themselves? When they returned,  the soldiers cried for joy; they were alive! Their  parents, wives, husbands, children, and friends also cried for joy. But after one or two weeks, the war welled up from within their deepest consciousness, and their families and the whole of society will have to endure their pain for a long time. If you are a psychologist, a playwright, a novelist, a composer,  a filmmaker,  a lawyer, a legislator, a peacemaker, or an environmentalist, please look deeply into the souls of the soldiers who returned from the war so you can see the real suffering that war causes, not only to soldiers, but to everyone. Then  project that image onto a huge screen for the whole nation to see and to learn. If we are able to share the truth  concerning  the Gulf War, we will be able to avoid starting another war like it in the future. We have to see how deep the wounds of war are.

      "Many of us are not healthy within, and yet we continue to look for things that only harm us more. We come home from work exhausted, and we do not know how to relax. We feel a kind of vacuum in ourselves, so we turn on the television. We live in a society where we always feel we are lacking something, and we want to fill it. If we don't turn on the TV, we eat or read or talk on the telephone. We are always trying to fill our void with something. Some people even do social or political work this way. But doing this only makes us less satisfied, hungrier, and we want to consume more. We feel alienated from ourselves. There  is so much anger and fear in us, and we want to suppress them, so we consume more and more things that only increase the level of toxicity  in us. We watch  films filled with screaming and violence. We read magazines and novels filled with hatred and confusion.

      "The  night I heard President  Bush give the order to attack Iraq, I could not sleep. I was angry and overwhelmed. The next morning in the middle of my lecture, I suddenly paused and told my friends,  \"I don't  think I will go to North  America this Spring.\" The  words just sprang out. Then  I continued  the lecture. In the afternoon,  one American student  told me, \"Thay, I think you have to go to the United States. Many friends there feel the same as you do, and it would help if you would go and support them.\" I did not say anything. I practiced breathing, walking, and sitting,  and a few days later, I decided to go. I saw that I was one with the American people, with George Bush, and with Saddam Hussein. I had been angry with President Bush, but after breathing consciously and looking deeply, I saw myself as President  Bush. I had not been practicing well enough to change this situation.  I saw that Saddam Hussein  was not the only person who lit the oil wells in Kuwait. All of us reached out our hands and lit them with him.\n",

      "In our collective consciousness, there are some seeds of nonviolence, and President Bush did begin with sanctions. But we did not support and encourage him enough, so he switched  to a more violent  way. We cannot  blame only him. The President acted the way he did because we acted the way we did. It is because we are not happy enough that we had a war. If we were happier, we would not take refuge in alcohol, drugs, war, and violence. Young people tell me that the most precious gift their parents can give is their own happiness. If Father and Mother  themselves are happy, the children  will receive seeds of happiness in their consciousness, and when they grow up, they will know how to make others happy too. When  parents fight, they sow seeds of suffering in the hearts of their children, and with that kind of heritage, children grow up unhappy. These are the roots of war. If children are unhappy, they will look for other things that are exactly like war-alcohol, drugs, and some TV  programs,  magazines, films, and other  violent \"cultural products.\"\n",

      "How can we transform our individual consciousness and the collective consciousness of our society? How can we refrain from consuming more toxic cultural products? We need guidelines-a diet-and we need to practice watering the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness in ourselves. The most important practice for preventing war is to stay in touch with what is refreshing, healing, and joyful inside us and all around us. If we practice walking mindfully, being in touch with the earth,  the air, the trees, and ourselves, we can heal ourselves, and our entire society will also be healed. If the whole nation would practice watering seeds of joy and peace and not just seeds of anger and violence, the elements of war in all of us will be transformed.\n",

We accept violence as a way of life and as a way to deal with problems. If we are not mindful-if we do not transform our shared suffering through  compassion and deep understanding-then one day our child will be the one who is beaten, or the one doing the beating.

It was commanded to do so by the brain, and the whole body got hurt at the same time. If the body blames the hand, that is not just. The hand acted because the body ordered  it to do so. When  there is good communication between the hand and the rest of the body, both the hand and the body will feel better.

If you went to war believing you were doing something important-trying to save a people, fighting evil-it was not your thinking  alone; it was the thinking  of the whole nation.

As long as there is no communication, there is no insight or compassion, and you will continue to suffer. Non-veterans do not understand veterans, and they refuse to listen to you.

But if your guilt persists for too long and becomes a complex, it blocks the way to joy and peace. The  way to liberate  yourself is to look deeply into the nature  of the guilt and self-hatred  and see the seeds of the suffering your ancestors, your parents, and the violence and lack of understanding in our society and its institutions. If you went to Vietnam with such a heritage of suffering, your actions were dictated  by those forces. That is also true of those who opposed the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  seeds  of suffering come  from  many directions. When your parents conceived you, you already had many seeds of happiness and suffering handed down by your ancestors. In your mother's womb, you received more seeds. If your  parents were  not  happy  together, you  received seeds of suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you grew up, if your parents  argued  and made each other  unhappy, you received those seeds of suffering,  too. If your  parents were alcoholic, they  made you suffer. If your father abused you, you suffered. Violent films and TV programs also watered  the seeds of fear and hatred in you. By the time you became a soldier, you were already filled with suffering. Then, in the army you were told that  the Vietnamese were beasts and you had to kill them. You cannot kill another human  being without visualizing him as a beast. The  mass media reinforced  this image, watering  the seeds of hatred and fear in order  to help you kill. So many seeds of violence  were watered  before  you were a soldier and during the time you were a soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "With  such a heritage of suffering, it is no surprise that you committed atrocities during the war. You knew you could be killed at any time. You saw your friends killed in ambushes. You became  more  and more  angry  and  more and more afraid. You may have killed children and women. You may have raped  women  or destroyed villages out of the fear, hatred,  and rage that were pouring  into you from so many directions. If you committed atrocities in Vietnam, it was the act of everyone-your father  who abused you, the  press, your  commander, everyone who watered the seeds of anger in you so that you could kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not need to go overseas to a war zone to see such violence. The Los Angeles policemen beating Rodney King,  that  was also Vietnam. War  manifests itself  in so many ways here and now. It is a reflection of our collective consciousness, which  is filled  with  suffering. With this heritage, the violence  will repeat  itself  over and over. There will be other Vietnams, other Gulf Wars. It is our task to look deeply into the violence, hatred, and fear to see their roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many soldiers who went to Vietnam had almost no contact with the Vietnamese  people,  culture, or life. They were told that the Vietnamese needed to be killed because they were evil and they were killers. Because it was a high-tech war, you just pushed buttons  to complete  many of your missions. You did not know or see the damage you were inflicting on the people and the country of Vietnam. If you flew one hundred  missions, you might have been successful as a soldier, but you did not know what was happening on the ground, because you were so far away. Once you realized what was happening on the ground, you began to have guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who did that bombing? Your President, your Congress,\n",
      "\n",
      "your Senate,  your  people, everyone.  You were only the hand ordered  to do it. Why keep the regret for yourself? Why keep the shame for yourself? When you begin to see that, you will be free, and we need you to share your insight  with everyone  so we will not be tempted  to do it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you came home after the war, the American people were cool, neglectful, and unappreciative, and of course you became angry. But your people did not know anything about  the war. Both hawks and doves had a very wrong view. You experienced the reality firsthand, and when you see that they were speaking out of ignorance, you will stop being angry at them. You were ignorant  too, but now you have learned, and you are liberated from your anger. Now you can offer your compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We who have experienced war directly have a responsibility to share our insight and experience concerning  the truth of war. We are the light at the tip of the candle. It is very hot, but it has the power of shining and illuminating. We can gather into groups to support each other. Practicing mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into the nature of the war and, with our insight, awaken our own people. We know what war is. We also know that the war is not only in us; it is in everyone-veterans and non-veterans. We must share our insight, not out of anger, but out of love. Our people need us to do it. I am trying my best, and I hope my friends will do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the war, one portion of the American population had to confront one portion of the Vietnamese population. These were the soldiers, the combatants. But the combatants and the non-combatants were not so different. In both, there were conflicts, and we have to look deeply to recognize these conflicts so that we can transform  them into understanding and compassion,  the fruit of insight. Insight can be brought about by mindfulness and looking deeply. If we do not have enough  mindfulness,  if we do not make enough  effort to look deeply, we will not have enough insight to transform  the conflicts that are within us, not to mention  those between people and those with other nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  basic condition for happiness is to be understood. Our  pain, hope, and despair  have to be understood  by someone for us to be happy. Vietnam veterans do not feel understood by their society, not even by members of their own  families.  Consciously or  unconsciously, veterans blame  the  non-veterans for  not  understanding them. There is so much misunderstanding to be dissolved. Veterans have suffered so much, and they have to take the time to understand their  own suffering. It may look as if the people of America understand  Gulf War veterans better, but I don't think so. Our ignorance about the nature of war is exactly the same. The war in Vietnam and the war in the Gulf were the same. It does not change  just by the way people welcome you back. Whether they shout at you or wave flags and welcome you, the true nature of the war is the same. We have to see that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many years have now passed since the Vietnam War. We are calm enough to realize that the Vietnam War was not necessary. We spent so much energy, so many human lives-millions of people died in Vietnam. There are still a lot of mines and bombs in Vietnam that have not been defused, and there are also many bombs in our souls that have not been defused. We need to defuse the bombs in our souls first. Then we can go to Vietnam to help defuse the bombs there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look deeply, we can see that all wars have their roots in the lack of understanding. We may be a little wiser now that twenty years have passed since the Vietnam War, but are we wise enough to prevent another war? In fact, we have already had another unnecessary war. In order to prevent yet another, we have to be prepared. We need time, of course, but we also need a way. If we know what to do, how to prepare, time is of secondary importance. We have to practice in a way that helps the whole nation see deeply into the nature of war. \n",
      "\n",
      "When  you look into your consciousness  and see your own pain, you also see the suffering and confusion of your society and your government. You have been embracing your suffering for many years, but when you see it directly, <i>it </i>will transform itself into a positive source of energy that will empower you to share your insight. To help others, we have to go to them with arms extended, filled with loving kindness and compassion. Blaming others or blaming ourselves can never help. The moment we have this insight, we will stop blaming, we will stop suffering, and we will have the energy to serve our people, even <i>if </i>they are still ignorant about the nature of the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one ever wins a war. The Vietnamese did not win the war. Millions of people in Vietnam are still suffering, and the country has been destroyed. Vietnam did not win anything. We cannot call it a victory. You cannot call the Gulf War a victory either. But many Americans did call it a victory, so they could have the feeling once again that America is the greatest power on Earth. They organized parades welcoming the soldiers back, trying to overcome what they called a defeat many years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't see any difference between a Vietnam veteran and a Gulf War veteran. I don't see any difference between the nature  of the war in Vietnam and the nature of the Gulf War. I don't see any difference between the consciousness of the people during the Vietnam War and the consciousness of the people during the Gulf War. Please look deeply and remove all of these false distinctions. Look deeply to see the true nature of our society and our collective consciousness. If the people  are educated, if the truth can break into their souls, we will all be able to go in the direction of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as the American people believe that  the Gulf War was moral, just, and liberating, they will be tempted to do the same thing the next time there is a conflict. How can we prevent that? By telling the truth,  by sharing our insight. We need to look deeply and to share our insights. We do not have time to embrace our pain in private anymore. We have to reveal ourselves. We have to allow our selves to be the light at the tip of the candle, and to join with other veterans. We who have had firsthand experience can share the reality with everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformation is the key. Looking just into the ocean of suffering, you see  that  it is immense. But if you turn around, you see the land. It is possible to transform  our hearts right in the present moment. If we do it, if we vow to go in the direction of peace and service, a rose will be born in us at that very moment. My brothers  and sisters who died during the war have been reborn as flowers. We have to harvest those flowers and form a beautiful bouquet. Please don't dwell on your memory of guilt. If we can learn from our suffering, all of those flowers will smile deeply at us, and we will be free.\n",

      "Several autumns ago, I walked up to the pine tree in my backyard and asked it one question: \"What is institutional violence?\" The  tree did not answer right away. So I sat at its roots and waited. The  backyard was covered with brilliantly colored leaves, the air was fresh, and suddenly I forgot that I was waiting for an answer. The  tree and I were just there, enjoying ourselves and each other. After sitting for a long time, I turned to the tree, smiled, and said, \"I no longer need an answer.\" Then  I thanked it and awarded it the Grand Transnational Peace Prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "When  I told my friends this, one asked, \"Do you give the Peace Prize often?\" I did not know how to answer. I wanted to, but it was difficult. Then another asked, \"What was the tree's answer to your question?\" Again, I did not know what to say, so I encouraged  her to go out and ask the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a novice monk, I was taught to look deeply at a cypress tree, and I learned that looking at a cypress can be very helpful. In fact, it is often easier to contemplate a cypress than to talk to a person. Before talking to a human being, watching a cypress can help. Soon I will organize an International Conference on Tree-Watching. All of the conferees will sit in the forest and just look at beautiful cypresses and pines. Then, in workshops, we can discuss strategies for tree-watching and also principles for appreciating human beings, even those who do not look or think exactly as we do. When I told this to the pine tree, it began to laugh. The tree was thinking about a particular conference held at a Hilton  Hotel dealing with the problems of the Third World. Not a single Third World representative had the opportunity to speak because eloquent spokespersons from the First World spoke for them. It was too difficult for them to listen to real Third World representatives, especially those whose ideas did not fit in with their own.\n",

      "I have lost my brother and I don't know where and how to find him. My brother was accused of destroying the community because he wanted to do things differently. Now the community continues, but my brother is missing. I have been on a pilgrimage for years looking for him, but without your help, I will never succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, I stood in a park and watched a three-year-old child with all my attention, and I was heartbroken. When people say, \"Things aren't too bad,\" I am not sure they understand. If we continue to live the way we do, what kind of world are we leaving for our children? Are we leaving any world at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my brother is still alive, and I will travel all over the world to find him. But I really need your help. Will you help me? He may be hard to recognize, but I believe the  time is near. When  the rest of us were asleep,  my brother saw what was happening. He tried to tell us, but we never listened. We were busy doing  other  things practicing meditation, praying, reciting scriptures. We were not at all awake. \n",
      "\n",
      "People thought my brother was dangerous, but it is not true. He is outspoken, but not dangerous. In fact, not listening to him is what is dangerous.  One person like my brother counts for a lot. When I think of him, I know that peace is possible. Please help me find him. If we succeed, there will be hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we try to remove the bombs from a distance, we can never succeed. The  bombs are us, and my brother understands that.

I just want to share some of the things my brother said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look at the three-year-old child, when I look at the pine tree, I feel co-responsible for their futures. I have no money and no weapons, but I know that by not being attentive enough, I have allowed the situation to develop this far. We are all much too busy. If my brother  returns home soon, we will have a chance. That is what I feel. But I am not sure all of us will be able to listen to him or understand him. We only have a chance if we are able to hear and truly understand him. If we are, we may be willing to change our ways. We still do not know how to take care of him. So, we have to prepare. We have to look deeply into our daily lives, at the ways we think and act, and begin to live in a way that allows the return  of my brother  to be possible, that allows a future to be possible.\n",

      "My brother said, \"Each person is important. Each being is important. Each moment is important.\" I am sure the pine tree and the three-year-old child understand this. Our opportunity for peace is not later. It is now. My brother was considered too dangerous for the material well-being of the community. He was a little too radical, too outspoken. That is why we did not want him. But I can assure you that one person like my brother  counts for a lot. I have confidence in my brother now, because as I think of him, I feel that anything is possible. Please help. Please be attentive. If you are attentive enough, you will find my brother. Please do not leave me in distress. Tell me, write me, telephone me the moment you see him. I know it may be hard to recognize him, but he is around. He may be living in a monastery or he may be somewhere on the street or in the marketplace. Or he may be within your own heart.\n",

      "\n",
      "Twenty years ago, I wrote four Chinese characters on a paper lampshade: \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately.\"  A few years later, in Singapore, I had the chance to practice these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 1976, and several of us were conducting an operation to rescue boat people in the Gulf of Siam. The project was called, \"When blood is shed, we all suffer.\" At that time, not many people knew about the presence of the boat people, and the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore would not allow them to land on their shores. The practice was to push the boat people back out to sea so they would die, and those on land would not have to deal with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hired two large ships-the <i>Leapdal </i>and the <i>Roland </i>to pick up refugees on the open sea, and two small ships the <i>Saigon 200 </i>and the <i>Blackmark-to </i>communicate  between the larger ships and to transport water, food, medicine, and supplies. Our plan was to fill the two large ships with refugees and take them to Australia and Guam, where, on arrival, we would inform the press so that the world would take notice of their plight, and they would not be sent back. In Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries, thousands of boat people had been sent back and many of them died in the sea. We had to do our work in secret, since the governments of the world did not want to acknowledge the plight of the boat people, and we knew we would be deported from Singapore if we were discovered. We managed to rescue nearly 800 boat people from the Gulf of Siam. On New Year's Eve, I rode out to sea in the small <i>Saigon 200 </i>to talk with the refugees on the larger ships. Using a wireless telephone, I wished them a Happy New Year. After we said good-bye, I headed back to shore, and, in the darkness, a huge wave welled up and drenched me. I had the impression that the power of darkness was warning me, \"It is the fate of these people to die. Why are you interfering?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we asked fishermen to pick these boat people up during the night, and then we took them by taxi to the French Embassy. In the morning, they were discovered by the French Ambassador, who was very kind. He called the police, knowing that because of his awareness of the presence of these people, they would get \"illegal refugee\" status. Even though they were put in prison, it was far better than being sent back to sea. Then we worked to help these people get accepted to go to France. We were trying to do many things to reverse the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time, we saw things you cannot  believe. We met with a group of sixty people in a barracks. They had just destroyed  their own boat so that the Malaysian police would not send them back out to sea, but the police were trying to repair their  boat in order  to do just that. When we saw these people, the men were just staring into empty space, and the women and children could not stop crying. One of them told us that they came with two boats. The Malaysian police had given them some water and told them to go to Singapore, where they would be welcomed, but this was not  true-the Singaporeans always towed boats back out into the ocean no matter how dangerous it was for the boat people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When  the two boats tried to sail away from Malaysia, one capsized. The sixty people on this boat had witnessed the deaths of everyone on the other boat, right in front of their eyes, and there was nothing they could do to help. So they decided to return to the shores of Malaysia, and this time they destroyed and sank their own boat the moment they arrived. They  did not want to be pushed out to sea again. We immediately went to the nearest town and called Reuters, AFP, and other  media people to come and take photographs. Because of this, the police did not send them back out to sea, but instead brought  them to prison and later to a refugee camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  suffering we touched doing this kind of work was so deep  that  if we did not  have a reservoir  of spiritual strength, we would not have been able to continue. During those days, we practiced sitting  and walking meditation, and eating our meals in silence in a very concentrated way. We knew that without this kind of discipline, we would fail in our work. The  lives of many people depended on our mindfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we had rescued nearly 800 people from small boats at sea, the government of Singapore discovered  us. We were close to succeeding in sending  the <i>Roland </i>and the <i>Leapdal </i>to Australia, but because of a leak to the press, several reporters tracked us down and published a story about our project. The press is sometimes  frivolous; they just want to write a story, even if human lives are at stake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because we had been exposed, the Singapore authorities gave the order for the police to surround  our flat at two o'clock in the morning. Two policemen were at the front door, two at the back, and two came in to get me. They took my travel documents and ordered me to leave the country within twenty-four hours. I knew that two large boatloads of people were waiting  for me to help bring them to shore. The police said, \"We will return your travel documents at the airport tomorrow.\" Those policemen were not like human beings. They were unable to understand the suffering of the boat people or how we were trying to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "What  could we do in such a situation? We had to breathe deeply and consciously. Otherwise we might panic, or fight with the police, or do something to express our anger at their lack of humanity. Knowing that in twenty-four hours we had to leave 800 people on two boats without food and water, what could we do? We could not go back to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time of the night, no one would answer phone calls. Even the French Embassy was not open. So all of us practiced walking meditation inside our small flat for the rest of the night. If you practice conscious breathing before some difficulty arises, you will be prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to find a way for 800 people to travel safely to Australia  or Guam. The  <i>Saigon 200 </i>and the <i>Blackmark </i>were not allowed to leave port to take food and water to the refugees on the <i>Leapdal </i>and the <i>Roland. </i>The <i>Roland </i>had enough fuel to reach Australia, but we needed to get food to them. Then its engine broke down. The day was very windy and the sea quite rough, and we worried about their safety, even just drifting offshore. But the Malaysian government would  not  allow the ship  to enter  Malaysian waters. I tried to get permission  to enter  a neighboring country in order to continue the rescue operation, but the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia would not grant me an entry visa. Even though I was on land, I too was drifting on the sea·, and my life was one with the 800 refugees on the ships. There were more problems than seemed possible to solve in just twenty-four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to practice the meditation topic, \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately,\" and I was surprised to find myself quite calm, not afraid or worried about anything. I was not just being careless. This was truly a peaceful state of mind, and in that state, I was able to overcome this difficult  situation. The  idea came to me to ask the French Embassy to intervene on my behalf so that my visa would be extended for a few more days, enough time to tie up all of these loose ends. And at five minutes before noon, just as the Immigration Department was about to close for the weekend and I would have to leave the country, the ex tension was granted. As long as I live, I will never forget those seconds of sitting meditation,  those breaths, those mindful steps during that night and that morning. Success came when I faced the problem directly. I vowed that if I could not have peace at that moment,  I would never be able to have peace. If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, the kind of peace I might realize in easier times would not mean anything. Practicing the topic, \"If you want peace, peace is with you immediately,\" I was able to resolve many problems one after another. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had to hand the refugees over to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees,  who kept them  for months and years in the camps in Malaysia. It was very painful. Yet we had conducted our operation in prayer and meditation, because we knew that everything depended on our mindfulness. We did sitting  meditation  late into the night every night,  then recited the <i>Heart Sutra, </i>as if we were in a monastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our work did bring the cries of the boat people to the attention  of the world. In 1977, the U.S. government increased the quota for Vietnamese  refugees to 7,000 per year, then 15,000, then 100,000. Australia and other countries followed suit. If we do our best, in full awareness and with a heart free from anger, we cannot worry about results.\n",

      "In 1976, I wrote a poem about a twelve-year-old girl, one of the boat people crossing  the Gulf of Siam, who was raped by a sea pirate and threw herself into the sea; the pirate, who was born in a remote village along the coast in Thailand; and me. I was not on the boat-in fact, I was thousands of miles away-but because I was mindful, I knew what was going on in the Gulf. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was angry when I received the news of her death, but I learned after meditating for several hours that I could not just take sides against the pirate. I saw that if I had been born in his village and brought up under the same conditions,  I would be exactly like him. Taking sides is too easy. Out of my suffering, I wrote this poem, entitled \"Please Call Me by My True  Names.\" I have many names, and when you call me by any of them,   I    have to say, \"Yes.\"\n",

      "As a novice in a Buddhist monastery, I was taught to be aware of each thing I did throughout the day, and for more than fifty years, I have been practicing this. When I started, I thought this kind of practice was only for beginners, that advanced people did more important things, but now I know that  the practice  of mindfulness is for everyone. Meditation  is to see into our own nature and wake up. If we are not aware of what is going on in ourselves and in the world, how can we see into our own nature and wake up? Are we really awake when we drink our tea, read our newspaper, or use the toilet?\n",

      "One day I asked a young Vietnamese refugee who was eating a bowl of rice whether children in his country eat rice of such high quality. He said no, because he knows the situation. He experienced hunger in Vietnam-there were times when he ate only dried potatoes, while he longed for a bowl of rice. In France, he has been eating rice for a year, and he is already beginning  to forget. But when I asked him, he remembered. I could not ask the same question to a French or American child, because they have not had the experience of hunger. It is difficult for people in the West to understand the situation in the Third World. It seems to have nothing to do with their situation. I told the Vietnamese boy that the rice he was eating in France came from Thailand, and that most Thai children do not have rice of such high quality, because the best rice is set aside for ex port to Japan and the West in exchange for foreign currency.\n",

      "In Vietnam we have a delicious banana called<i>chuối già, </i>but the children  and adults in Vietnam do not have the right to eat these bananas because they are all for export. In return, Vietnam gets guns in order to kill ourselves and our brothers. Some of us practice this exercise of mindfulness: We sponsor a child in the Third World and get news from him or her, thus keeping in touch with the reality outside. We try many ways to be awake, but our society still keeps us forgetful. Meditation is to help us remember. There are other  ways to nourish awareness. One thirteen-year-old Dutch  boy visited our retreat center  and joined us for a silent lunch. It was the first time he had eaten in silence, and he was embarrassed. Afterwards, I asked him if he had felt uncomfortable, and he said yes. I explained that the reason we eat in silence is to be in touch with the food and the presence of each other. If we talk a lot, we cannot enjoy these things. I asked him if there was some time when he turned off the TV in order to enjoy his dinner  more, and he said yes. Later in the day, I invited him to join us for another  silent meal, and he enjoyed it very much. Society bombards us with so many noises that we have lost our taste for silence. Every time we have a few minutes, we turn on the TV or make a phone call. We do not know how to be ourselves without something  to distract us. So, the first thing we need to do is to return to ourselves and reorganize our daily lives so that we are not just victims of society and other people.\n",

If we are not peaceful, if we are not feeling well in our skin, we cannot demonstrate real peace, and we cannot raise our children well either. To take good care of our children means to take good care of ourselves, to be aware of our situation. Please sit down with your child and, together, contemplate the little  flowers  that grow among the grasses. Breathing in and out, smiling together-that is real peace education. When we can learn to appreciate these small, beautiful things, we will not have to search for anything else. We can be peace ourselves, and we can make peace with our friends and even with our so called enemies.\n",

      "In 1951, I went with a few brother  monks to a remote mountain in the Dai Lao region of Vietnam  to build a meditation center. We asked some native mountain people for their help, and two Montagnards  from the Jarai tribe joined us in clearing the forest, cutting trees into lumber, and gathering other materials for construction. They were hard workers, and we were grateful for their assistance. But after working with us only three days, they stopped coming. Without their help, we had many difficulties, as we were not familiar with the ways of the forest. So we walked to their village and asked what had happened. They said, \"Why should we return so soon? You already paid us enough to live for a month! We will come again when we run out of rice.\" At the time, it was a common practice to un derpay the Montagnards,  to avoid just this kind of thing. We had paid them properly, and, surely enough, they stopped coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people criticized the Montagnards for this ethic.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said that this laziness could only lead to trouble, and they listed four reasons to support  their claim: (1) The Montagnards would be happier and more comfortable if they would work harder. (2) They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods. (3) The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others. (4) If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasions and the exploitation of others. There may be some validity to each of these points, but if we look closely at the lives of the Montagnards, we will come to understand them, and ourselves, better.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. <i>The Montagnards  would be happier and more comfortable if they would work harder.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Montagnards lived simply. They did not store much food at all. They had no bank accounts.  But they were much more serene and at peace with themselves, nature, and other  people, than almost anyone in the world. I am not suggesting that we all return  to primitive life-styles, but it is important  that we see and appreciate the wisdom contained in a life-style like this, a wisdom that those of us immersed  in modernization and economic  growth have lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much stuff do we need to be happy and comfortable? Happiness and comfort vary according to taste. Some people think they need three or four houses-one on the Riviera, one in New York, one in Tokyo, and perhaps one in Fiji. Others find that a two or three-room hut is quite enough. In fact, if you own a dozen luxurious houses, you may rarely have time to enjoy them. Even when you have the time, you may not know how to sit peacefully in one place. Always seeking distraction-going to restaurants, the theater, or dinner parties, or taking vacations that exhaust you even more, you can't stand being alone and facing yourself directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In former times, people spent hours drinking one cup of tea with dear friends. A cup of tea does not cost much, but today, we go to a cafe and take less than five minutes  to drink our tea or coffee, and even during that short time, we are mostly thinking and talking about other things, and we never even notice our tea. We who own just one house barely have the time to live in it. We leave home early in the morning  after a quick breakfast and go off to work, spending an hour in the car or the train and the rest of the day in the office. Then we return home exhausted, eat dinner, watch TV, and collapse so we can get up early for work. Is this \"progress\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Montagnards  were quite content to live in simple bamboo  and palm-leaf  huts and wash their  clothes  by hand. They  refused to be slaves to economic pressures. Content with just a few possessions, they rarely needed to spend their time or money seeing doctors or psychotherapists for stress-related ailments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. <i>They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "How much do we need to save? We do not save air, because we trust that it will be available to us when we need it. Why must we stockpile food, money, or other things for our own private use, while so many others are hungry?\n",
      "\n",
      "People who accumulate a house, a car, a position, and so forth, identify themselves with what they own, and they think that if they lose their house, their car, or their position, they would not be themselves. To me, they are already lost. By accumulating  and saving, they have constructed a false self, and in the process they have forgotten their truest and deepest self. Psychotherapists  can try to help, but the cause of this illness is in their way of life. One way to help such a person would be to place him in an \"underdeveloped\" country where he could grow <i>his </i>own food and make his own clothes. Sharing the fate and simple life of peasants might help him heal quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have enough resources and know-how to assure every human being of adequate shelter and food every day. If we don't help others live, we ourselves are not going to be able to live either. We are all in the same boat-the planet Earth. Why not put our efforts into trying to help each other and save our boat instead of accumulating savings only for ourselves and our own children?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. <i>The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the Montagnards could have spent more time working in order to send aid to people who were starving in other parts of the world. If they did not do so, it was because they didn't know much about the existence of other nations. They certainly did help their own tribal members whenever they got sick or when a crop was destroyed by some natural disaster. But let us reflect for a moment on\n",
      "what the Montagnard people did <i>not </i>do.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not harm or exploit others. They grew their own food and exchanged some of their products with other people. They did not do violence to nature. They cut only enough  wood to build their  houses. They  cleared  only enough land to plant their crops. Because of their simple life-style,  they did not overconsume natural  resources. They did not pollute the air, water, or soil. They used very little fuel and no electricity. They did not own private cars, dishwashers, or electric razors. The way they lived enabled natural resources to continually renew themselves. A lifestyle like theirs demonstrates that a future for humankind is possible, and this is the most helpful thing anyone can do to help others.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. <i>If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasion and the exploitation of others.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that the Montagnards were exploited by others and were often victims of social injustice. They lived in re mote mountain areas. If others settled nearby, they risked losing their land due to a lack of means with which to defend themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "People said that if the rest of us in Vietnam worked as little as they did, our country would never be able to resist foreign intervention  and exploitation. It seems clear that the Montagnards and others  like them had to do something  more. But what? If the Montagnards would have moved down to the more populated areas, they would have seen men and women working extremely hard and getting poorer. They would have seen how expensive food, lodging, electricity, water, clothing, and transportation were. Their civilized countrymen were working all day long and could barely pay for the most basic items they consumed. The Montagnards in the forest did not need to spend any money. If they would have lived and worked in the cities, how would that have helped Vietnam resist foreign intervention?  All they would have learned  is that in the socalled developed nations, resources are used to make bombs and other elaborate weapons, while many citizens live in misery. The Montagnards might well need nuclear weapons to resist foreign intervention if they were to catch up with their more \"developed\" brothers and sisters. Will social injustice ever be abolished before all people wake up and realize that unless we let others live, we ourselves will not be able to live?\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic growth may be necessary for the welfare of people,  but the present  rate of economic  growth  is destroying  humanity  and nature. Injustice is rampant.  We humans are part of nature, and doing harm to nature only harms us. It is not just the poor and oppressed who are victims  of environmental damage.  The  affluent  are  just as much victims of pollution  and the exploitation  of resources. We must look at the whole picture and ask, \"Does our way of life harm nature? Does our way of life harm our fellow humans? Do we live at the expense of others, at the expense of the present, and at the expense of the future?\" If we answer truthfully, we will know how to orient our lives and our actions.

      "Although Human beings are a part of nature, we single ourselves out and classify other animals and living beings as \"nature,\" while acting as if we were somehow separate from it. Then we ask, \"How should we deal with nature?\" We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! Nonviolently. We should not harm ourselves, and we should not harm nature. To harm nature is to harm ourselves, and vice versa. If we knew how to deal with ourselves and our fellow human beings, we would know how to deal with nature. Human beings and nature are inseparable. By not caring properly for either, we harm both.\n",

      "We can only be happy when we accept ourselves as we are. We must first be aware of all the elements within us, and then we must bring them into harmony.

This understanding helps us respect nature  in ourselves and also helps us bring about healing If we harm another  human being, we harm ourselves.\n",

      "To accumulate wealth and own excessive portions of the world's natural resources is to deprive our fellow humans of the chance to live. To participate in oppressive and unjust social systems is to widen the gap between rich and poor and thereby aggravate the situation of social injustice. Yet we tolerate excess, injustice, and war, while remaining unaware that the human race as a family is suffering. While some members of the human family are suffering and starving, for us to enjoy false security and wealth is a sign of insanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  fate of each individual is inextricably linked to the fate of the whole human race. We must let others live if we ourselves want to live. The only alternative to coexistence is co-nonexistence. A civilization in which we kill and ex ploit others for our own aggrandizement is sick. For us to have a healthy civilization, everyone must be born with an equal right to education, work, food, shelter, world citizenship, and the ability to circulate freely and settle on any part of the Earth. Political and economic systems that deny one person these rights harm the whole human family. We must begin by becoming aware of what is happening to every member of the human family if we want to repair the damage already done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To bring about  peace, we must work for harmonious coexistence. If we continue to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world, imprisoning ourselves in our narrow concerns  and immediate  problems, we are not likely to make peace or to survive. It is difficult for one individual to preserve harmony among the elements within himself, and it is even more difficult to preserve harmony among the members of the human family. We have to understand the human race to bring it into harmony. Cruelty and disruption destroy the harmony of the family. We need legislation  that  keeps us from doing  violence  to ourselves  or nature, and prevents us from being disruptive and cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have created a system that we cannot control. This system imposes itself on us, and we have become its slaves. Most of us, in order to have a house, a car, a refrigerator, a Tv, and so on, must sacrifice our time and our lives in exchange. We are constantly under the pressure of time. In former times, we could afford three hours for one cup of tea, enjoying the company of our friends in a serene and spiritual  atmosphere. We could organize a party to celebrate the blossoming of one orchid in our garden. But to day we can no longer afford these things. We say that time is money. We have created a society in which the rich be come richer and the poor become poorer, and in which we are so caught up in our own immediate problems that we cannot afford to be aware of what is going on with the rest of the human family. We see images on Tv, but we do not really understand our Third World brothers and sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The individual and all of humanity are both part of nature and should be able to live in harmony with nature. Nature can be cruel and disruptive and therefore, at times, needs to be controlled. To control is not to dominate or oppress  but to harmonize  and equilibrate. We must be deep friends with nature in order to control certain aspects of it. This  requires  a full understanding of nature. Typhoons, tornadoes, droughts, floods, volcanic eruptions, and proliferations of harmful insects all constitute danger and destruction to life. Although  parts of nature,  these things disrupt the harmony of nature. We should be able to prevent to a large degree the destruction that natural disasters cause, but we must do it in a way that preserves life and encourages harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  excessive use of pesticides that kill all kinds of insects and upset the ecological balance is an example of our lack of wisdom in trying  to control  nature. Economic growth that devastates nature by polluting and exhausting nonrenewable  resources, rendering  the Earth impossible for beings to live on, is another. Such economic growth may appear to benefit some humans, but in reality it disrupts and destroys the whole of nature to which we all belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harmony and equilibrium in the individual, society, and nature are being destroyed. Individuals are sick, society is sick, and nature is sick. We must reestablish harmony and equilibrium, but how? Where can we begin the work of healing? Would we begin with the individual, society, or the environment? We must work in all three  domains. People of different disciplines tend to stress their particular areas. For example, politicians consider an effective rearrangement of society necessary for the salvation of humans and nature, and therefore urge that everyone engage in the struggle to change political systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "We Buddhist monks are like psychotherapists in that we tend to look at the problem from the viewpoint of mental health. Meditation  aims at creating harmony and equilibrium in the life of the individual. Buddhist meditation uses the breath as a tool to calm and harmonize the whole human being. As in any therapeutic practice, the patient is placed in an environment that favors the restoration  of harmony. Usually psychotherapists  spend their time observing and then advising their patients. I know of some, however, who, like monks, observe themselves first, recognizing the need to free their own selves from the fears, anxieties, and despair that exist in each of us. Many therapists seem to think that they themselves have no mental problems, but the monk recognizes in himself the susceptibility to fears and anxieties, and to the mental illness that is caused by the inhuman social and economic systems that prevail in today's world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Buddhists believe that the reality of the individual, society, and nature's integral being will reveal itself to us as we recover, gradually ceasing to be possessed by anxiety, fear, and the dispersion of mind. Among the three-individual, society, and nature-it is the individual who begins to effect change. But in order to effect change, he or she must have personally recovered, must be whole. Since this requires an environment favorable to healing, he or she must seek the kind of life-style that is free from destructiveness. Efforts to change the environment and to change the individual are both necessary, but it is difficult to change the environment if individuals are not in a state of equilibrium. From the mental health point of view, efforts for us to recover our humanness should be given priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restoring mental health does not mean simply helping individuals adjust to the modern world of rapid economic growth. The world is sick, and adapting to an unwell environment will not bring real health. Many people who seek the help of a psychotherapist are really victims of modem life, which separates human beings from the rest of nature. One way to help such a person may be to move him or her to a rural area where he can cultivate the land, grow his own food, wash his clothes in a clear river, and live simply, sharing  the same life as millions of peasants around  the world. For psychotherapy to be effective, we need environmental change, and psychotherapists must participate  in efforts to change the environment. But that is only half their task. The  other half is to help individuals be themselves, not by helping them adapt to an ill environment, but by providing them with the strength  to change it. To tranquilize them is not the way. The explosion of bombs, the burning of napalm, the violent deaths of relatives and neighbors, the pressures  of time, noise, and pollution, the lonely crowds have all been created by the disruptive course of our economic  growth. They  are all sources of mental illness, and they must end. Anything we can do to bring them to an end is preventive medicine. Political activities are not the only means to this end.\n",
      "\n",
      "While helping their particular patients, psychotherapists must, at the same time, recognize  their responsibility  to the whole human family. Their work must also prevent others  from becoming  ill. They  are challenged  to safe guard their own humanness. Like others, psychotherapists and monks need to observe first themselves and their own ways of life. If they do, I believe they will seek ways to disengage  themselves  from  the present  economic  systems in order  to help reestablish  harmony and balance in life. Monks and psychotherapists are human beings. We cannot escape mental illness if we do not apply our disciplines to ourselves. Caught in forgetfulness and acquiescence to the status quo, we will gradually become victims of fear, anxiety, and egotism of all kinds. But if psychotherapists  and monks, through mutual sharing, help each other apply our disciplines  to our own lives, we will rediscover  the harmony in ourselves and thereby help the whole human family.\n",

      "When I first left Vietnam, I had a dream in which I was a young  boy, smiling  and at ease, in my own land, surrounded by my own people, in a time of peace. There  was a beautiful hillside, lush with trees and flowers, and on it was a little house. But each time I approached the hillside, obstacles prevented me from climbing it, and then I woke up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  dream recurred many times. I continued to do my work and to practice mindfulness,  trying to be in touch with the beautiful trees, people, flowers, and sunshine that surrounded me in Europe  and North America. I looked deeply at these things, and I played under the trees with the children exactly as I had in Vietnam. Mter a year, the dream  stopped. Seeds of acceptance and  joy had been planted in me, and I began to look at Europe, America, and other countries in Asia as also my home. I realized that my home is the Earth. Whenever I felt homesick for Vietnam, I went outside into a backyard or a park, and found a place to practice  breathing, walking, and smiling  among  the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "But some cities had very few trees, even then. I can imagine someday soon a city with no trees in it at all. Imagine a city that has only one tree left. People there are mentally disturbed, because they are so alienated from nature. Then one doctor in the city sees why people are getting sick, and he offers each person who comes to him this prescription: \"You are sick because you are cut off from Mother Nature. Every morning, take a bus, go to the tree in the center of the city, and hug it for fifteen minutes. Look at the beautiful green tree and smell its fragrant bark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After three months  of practicing  this, the patient will feel much better. But because many people suffer from the same malady and the doctor  always gives the same prescription, after a short time, the line of people waiting their tum to embrace the tree gets to be very long, more than a mile, and people begin to get impatient. Fifteen minutes is now too long for each person to hug the tree, so the city council legislates a five-minute maximum. Then  they have to shorten it to one minute, and then only a few seconds. Finally, there is no remedy at all for the sickness.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are not mindful,  we might  be in that situation soon. We have to remember that our body is not limited to what lies within  the boundary of our skin. Our  body is much more immense.  We know that  if our  heart  stops beating, the flow of our life will stop, but we do not take the time to notice the many things outside of our bodies that are equally essential for our survival. If the ozone layer around our Earth were to disappear for even an instant, we would die. If the sun were to stop shining, the flow of our life would stop. The sun is our second heart, our heart outside of our body. It gives all life on Earth the warmth necessary for existence. Plants live thanks to the sun. Their leaves absorb the sun's energy, along with carbon dioxide from the air, to produce food for the tree, the flower, the plankton. And thanks to plants, we and other animals can live. All of us-people, animals,  plants, and minerals-\"consume\" the sun, directly and indirectly. We cannot begin to describe all the effects of the sun, that great heart outside of our body.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look at green vegetables, we should know that it is the sun that is green and not just the vegetables. The green color in the leaves of the vegetables is due to the presence  of the sun. Without the sun,  no living being could  survive. Without sun, water, air, and soil,  there would be no vegetables. The vegetables are the coming-to gether of many conditions near and far.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no phenomenon in the universe that does not intimately concern us, from a pebble resting at the bottom of the ocean, to the movement of a galaxy millions of light years away. Walt Whitman said, \"I believe a blade of grass is no less than  the  journey-work of the stars...\" These words are not philosophy. They come from the depths of his soul. He also said, \"I am large, I contain multitudes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This  might be called a meditation on \"interbeing endlessly interwoven.\" All phenomena are interdependent. When we think of a speck of dust, a flower, or a human being, our thinking cannot break loose from the idea of unity, of one, of calculation. We see a line drawn between one and many, one and not one. But if we truly realize the interdependent nature of the dust, the flower, and the human being, we see that unity cannot  exist without  diversity. Unity and diversity interpenetrate each other freely. Unity is diversity, and diversity is unity. This is the principle of interbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a mountain climber or someone who enjoys the countryside or the forest, you know that forests are our lungs outside of our bodies. Yet we have been acting in a way that has allowed millions of square miles of land to be deforested, and we have also destroyed the air, the rivers, and parts of the ozone layer. We are imprisoned in our small selves, thinking only of some comfortable conditions for this small self, while we destroy our large self. If we want to change the situation, we must begin by being our true selves. To be our true selves means we have to <i>be </i>the forest, the river, and the ozone layer. If we visualize our selves as the forest, we will experience the hopes and fears of the trees. If we don't do this, the forests will die, and we will lose our chance for peace. When we understand  that we inter-are with the trees, we will know that it is up to us to make an effort to keep the trees alive. In the last twenty years, our automobiles and factories have created acid rain that has destroyed so many trees. Because we inter-are with the trees, we know that if they do not live, we too will disappear very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "We humans think we are smart,  but an orchid, for ex ample, knows how to produce noble, symmetrical flowers, and a snail knows how to make a beautiful, well-proportioned shell. Compared with their knowledge, ours is not worth much at all. We should bow deeply before the orchid and the snail and join our palms reverently before the monarch  butterfly and the magnolia tree. The  feeling of respect for all species will help us recognize the noblest nature in ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "An oak tree is an oak tree. That  is all an oak tree needs to do. If an oak tree is less than an oak tree, we will all be in trouble. In our former  lives, we were rocks, clouds, and trees. We have also been an oak tree. This is not just Buddhist; it is scientific. We humans are a young species. We were plants, we were trees, and now we have become humans. We have to remember  our past existences and be humble. We can learn a lot from an oak tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "All life is impermanent. We are all children of the Earth, and, at some time, she will take us back to herself again. We are continually arising from Mother Earth, being nurtured  by her, and then returning to her. Like us, plants are born, live for a period of time, and then return to the Earth. When  they decompose, they fertilize our gardens. Living vegetables and decomposing vegetables are part of the same reality. Without one, the other cannot be. After six months, compost becomes fresh vegetables again. Plants  and the Earth  rely on each other.  Whether the Earth  is fresh, beautiful, and green, or arid and parched depends on the plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also depends on us. Our way of walking on the Earth has a great influence on animals and plants. We have killed so many animals and plants and destroyed their environments. Many are now extinct. In turn, our environment is now harming us. We are like sleepwalkers, not knowing what we are doing or where we are heading. Whether we can wake up or not depends on whether we can walk mindfully on our Mother Earth. The future of all life, including our own, depends on our mindful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birds' songs express joy, beauty, and purity, and evoke in us vitality and love. So many beings in the universe love us unconditionally. The trees, the water, and the air don't ask anything of us; they just love us. Even though we need this kind of love, we continue to destroy them. By destroying the animals, the air, and the trees, we are destroying ourselves. We must learn to practice unconditional love for all beings so that the animals, the air, the trees, and the minerals can continue to be themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our ecology should be a deep ecology-not only deep, but universal. There is pollution  in our consciousness. Television, films, and newspapers are forms of pollution for us and our children. They sow seeds of violence and anxiety in us and pollute our consciousness, just as we destroy our environment by farming with chemicals, clear-cutting the trees, and polluting the water. We need to protect the ecology of the Earth and the ecology of the mind, or this kind of violence and recklessness will spill over into even more areas of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Earth, our green beautiful Earth is in danger, and all of us know it. Yet we act as if our daily lives have nothing to do with the situation of the world. If the Earth were your body, you would be able to feel many areas where she is suffering. Many people are aware of the world's suffering, and their hearts are filled with compassion. They know what needs to be done, and they engage in political, social, and environmental work to try to change things. But after a period of intense involvement, they become discouraged, because they lack the strength needed to sustain a life of action. Real strength  is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we change our daily lives-the way we think, speak, and act-we change the world. The  best way to take care of the environment is to take care of the environmentalist. Many Buddhist teachings help us understand our inter connectedness with our Mother,  the Earth.  One of the deepest is the <i>Diamond Sutra, </i>which is written in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and his senior disciple, Subhuti. It begins  with  this  question  by Subhuti: \"If daughters and sons of good families wish to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind, what should they rely on and what should they do to master their thinking?\" This is the same as asking, \"If I want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and principles should I use?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The  Buddha answers, \"We have to do our best to help every living being cross the ocean of suffering. But after all beings have arrived at the shore of liberation, no being at all has been carried to the other shore. If you are still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a life span, you are not an authentic bodhisattva.\" Self, person, living being, and life span are four notions that pre vent us from seeing reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is one. We do not need to slice it into pieces and call this or that piece a \"self.\" What we call a self is made only of non-self elements. When  we look at a flower, for example, we may think that it is different from \"non-flower\" things. But when we look more deeply, we see that everything in the cosmos is in that flower. Without  all of the non-flower elements-sunshine, clouds, earth, minerals, heat, rivers, and consciousness-a flower cannot be. That is why the Buddha teaches that the self does not exist. We have to discard all distinctions between self and non-self. How can anyone work to protect the environment without this insight?\n",
      "\n",
      "The second notion that prevents us from seeing reality is the notion of a person, a human being. We usually discriminate between humans and non-humans, thinking that we are more important than other species. But since we humans are made of non-human elements, to protect our selves we have to protect all of the non-human  elements. There is no other way. If you think, \"God created man in His own image and He created other  things for man to use,\" you are already making the discrimination that man is more  important than  other  things.  When  we see that humans have no self, we see that to take care of the environment (the non-human elements) is to take care of humanity. The best way to take good care of men and women so that they can be truly healthy and happy is to take care of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know ecologists who are not happy in their families. They work hard to improve the environment, partly to escape family life. If someone is not happy within himself, how can he help the environment? That is why the Buddha teaches that to protect the non-human elements is to protect humans, and to protect humans is to protect non-human elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third notion we have to break through is the notion of a living being. We think that we living beings are different from inanimate objects, but according to the principle of interbeing, living beings are comprised of non-living being elements. When  we look into  ourselves,  we see minerals and all  other non-living-being elements. Why discriminate against what we call inanimate? To protect living beings, we must protect the stones, the soil, and the oceans. Before the atomic bomb was dropped  on Hiroshima, there  were many beautiful stone  benches in the parks. As the Japanese were rebuilding their city, they dis covered that these stones were dead, so they carried them away and buried them. Then  they brought in live stones. Do not think these things are not alive. Atoms are always moving. Electrons move at nearly the speed of light. Ac cording to the teaching of Buddhism,  these atoms and stones are consciousness itself. That is why discrimination by living beings against non-living beings should be dis carded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  last notion is that of a life span. We think that we have been alive since a certain point in time and that prior to that moment, our life did not exist. This distinction between life and non-life is not correct. Life is made of death, and death  is made of life. We have to accept  death;  it makes life possible. The cells in our body are dying every day, but we never think to organize funerals for them. The death of one cell allows for the birth of another. Life and death are two aspects of the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so that others may live. This deep meditation brings forth non-fear, non-anger, and non-despair, the strengths we need for our work. With non-fear, even when we see that a problem is huge, we will not burn out. We will know how to make small, steady steps. If those who work to protect the environment  contemplate  these four notions, they will know how to be and how to act.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another Buddhist text, the <i>Avatamsaka ('Adorning theBuddha with Flowers') Sutra, </i>the Buddha further elaborates his insights concerning our \"interpenetration\" with our environment. Please meditate with me on the \"Ten Penetrations\":\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is, \"All worlds penetrate a single pore. A single pore penetrates all worlds.\" Look deeply at a flower. It may be tiny, but the sun, the clouds, and everything else in the cosmos penetrates it. Nuclear physicists say very much the same thing: one electron is made by all electrons; one electron is in all electrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second penetration  is, \"All living beings penetrate one body. One body penetrates  all living beings.\" When you kill a living being, you kill yourself and everyone else as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is, \"Infinite time penetrates one second. One second penetrates infinite time.\" A <i>ksana </i>is the shortest period of time, actually much shorter than a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth penetration is, \"All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching.  One teaching penetrates all Buddhist teachings.\" As a young monk, I had the opportunity to learn that Buddhism is made of non-Buddhist elements. So, whenever I study Christianity or Judaism, I find the Buddhist elements in them, and vice versa. I always respect non-Buddhist teachings. All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching,  and one teaching  penetrates all Buddhist teachings. We are free.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth penetration is, \"Innumerable spheres enter one sphere. One sphere enters innumerable spheres.\" A sphere is a geographical  space. Innumerable spheres  penetrate into one particular area, and one particular area enters into innumerable spheres. It means that when you destroy one area, you destroy every area. When you save one area, you save all areas. A student asked me, \"Thay,  there  are so many urgent problems, what should I do?\" I said, \"Take one thing and do it very deeply and carefully, and you will be doing everything at the same time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sixth penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate one organ. One organ penetrates all sense organs\"-eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. To take care of one means to take care of many. To take care of your eyes means to take care of the eyes of innumerable living beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seventh penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate non-sense  organs. Non-sense  organs penetrate  all sense organs.\"  Not only do non-sense organs penetrate  sense organs, they also penetrate non-sense organs. There  is no discrimination. Sense organs are made of non-sense-organ elements. That is why they penetrate  non-sense  organs. This helps us remember the  teaching of the  <i>Diamond Sutra.</i>\n",
      "\n",
      "The eighth penetration  is, \"One perception  penetrates all perceptions. All perceptions penetrate one perception.\" If your perception is not accurate, it will influence all other perceptions  in yourself and others. Suppose a bus driver has an incorrect  perception. We know what may happen. One perception penetrates all perceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  ninth penetration  is, \"Every sound penetrates one sound. One sound penetrates every sound.\" This is a very deep teaching. If we understand  one sound or one word, we can understand all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  tenth penetration is, \"All times penetrate one time. One time penetrates all times-past, present, and future. In one second, you can find the past, present, and future.\" In the past, you can see the present and the future. In the present, you can find the past and future. In the future, you can find the past and present. They \"inter-contain\" each other.  Space contains  time, time contains  space. In the teaching of interpenetration, one determines the other, the other determines this one. When we realize our nature of interbeing, we will stop blaming and killing, because we know that we inter-are. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interpenetration is an important teaching,  but it still suggests that things outside of one another penetrate into each other. Interbeing is a step forward. We are already inside, so we don't have to enter. In contemporary nuclear physics, people talk about implicit order and explicit order. In the explicit order, things exist outside of each otherthe table outside of the flower, the sunshine outside of the cypress tree. In the implicit  order, we see that  they are inside each other-the sunshine  inside the cypress tree. Interbeing is the implicit order. To practice mindfulness and to look deeply into the nature of things is to discover the true nature of interbeing. There we find peace and develop the strength to be in touch with everything. With this understanding, we can easily sustain the work of loving and caring for the Earth and for each other for a long time.\n",

      "All things are interconnected. The nuclear arms race is inextricably linked to other forms of violence and suffering that afflict life on Earth. Recognizing  this, I propose reductions in military spending with corresponding allocations to be used for the alleviation of world hunger. As the strongest nation on Earth, the United States can take the first step with an independent initiative for stopping  the arms race, and this action can be taken regardless of the actions that are taken or not taken by any other country. Let the money that is saved by reductions in defense spending be spent  for jobs and industries that grow, process, and ship food to the starving children of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I address  this  proposal  to the  people  of the  United States, and in particular to my colleagues in the religious and peace communities. Forty thousand children a day and ten million people a year die of starvation. This suffering cannot be alleviated by government action alone. As individuals, we must also assume responsibility and lend our efforts and our hearts to the work of ending human suffering and building human solidarity. For example, if people in Western countries  reduced their consumption  of meat and alcohol by just fifty percent,  the resultant  availability of grain would change the fate of millions of starving people in the developing countries. \n",

      "During the war in Vietnam  we proposed  a cease-fire plan to the Americans. It was the voice of those who were under the bomb. The  proposal was for the Americans to independently declare a cease-fire, and then invite  the other side to respond, promising that if the other responded, the U.S. would set a timetable  for total  withdrawal from Vietnam. The same can be done regarding the manufacture of arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the United  States will independently declare a stop to the arms race, and invite Russia, China,  and all other arms-producing countries to do the same. This could be done for six months,  with or without  reciprocation. Then, if other  countries do reciprocate, the U.S. could take another  step toward complete and general disarmament. In this way, through varying stages, defense spending could  be reduced  while at the same time resources could be redirected to alleviate human suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal is offered for the endorsement of all religious denominations, international peace organizations, and other people and organizations that share in the common cause of disarmament and development. I strongly urge these friends to work to create jobs that nurture  the peace and well-being of humanity in order to offer alternative employment to those engaged in the manufacture and sale of the weapons that, even at this moment, are destroying lives of people all over the world.\n",

      "In a deep forest in the highlands stood an ancient  tree. No one knew how many thousands of years it had lived. Its trunk was so large that the arm spans of eighteen  people could not embrace it; great roots pushed up through  the ground  and spread to a radius of fifty meters. The  earth beneath the tree's shadow was unusually cool. Its bark was as hard as rock; if you pressed a fingernail against it, pain ran through  your finger. Its branches  held tens of thou sands of nests, sheltering  hundreds of thousands of birds, both large and small.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, when the sun rose, the first rays of light were like a conductor's baton, initiating a mighty symphony, the voices of thousands of birds, a symphony  as majestic  as the sun dawning  behind  the summit  of the mountain. All the creatures of the mountain and forest arose, either on two feet or four, slowly, in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the great tree there was one hole large as a grapefruit from Bien Hoa and twelve meters from the ground. In the hole lay a small brown egg. No one could say if a bird had brought  the beautiful egg to the hole. Some thought  the egg had not come from a living bird but had been forged by the sacred air of the forest and the life energy of the great tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty years passed; the egg remained  intact. Some nights, birds would be startled from their sleep by a cloud hovering over the hole and a brilliant light shining there, illuminating an entire  corner  of the forest.  Finally, one night,  under a full moon, the egg opened  and a strange bird was born. The bird was very little; it gave a small chirp in the cold night. The moon was very bright; the stars were very bright. The  tiny bird cried throughout the night. Its cry was neither tragic nor bold; it was a cry of surprise and strangeness. It cried until the sun appeared. The first rays of light opened the symphony; thousands of birds' voices broke forth. From that moment, the little bird cried no more.\n",

      "It  grew  quickly. The  nuts  and  grains  mother birds brought to the hole were always plenty. Soon the hole in the tree became too small, and the bird had to find another place, much larger, in which to live. It now knew how to fly; it looked for its own food and gathered sticks of straw to cover the floor of its new nest. Strangely, although the egg had been brown, the bird was as white as snow. When it flew, its wingspan was vast, and it moved slowly and very quietly. Often it flew to faraway places where white waterfalls tumbled  day and night like the majestic  breath  of earth and sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the  bird did not  return  for several  days. When  it returned, it lay in its nest all day and night, thoughtfully and quietly. Its two eyes were very bright; they never lost the look of surprise they had from the beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in the ancient forest of Dai Lao, a hermit's small hut stood on the slope of a hill. There a monk had lived for almost fifty years. The bird often flew across Dai Lao forest; from time to time it saw the monk walking slowly down the path to the spring,  holding a water  jug in his hand. One day, smoke gently lingered over the roof of the humble hut and an atmosphere of warmth surrounded the hill. The bird saw two monks together on the path leading from the spring to the hut, speaking as they walked. That night the bird remained in Dai Lao forest. Concealed in the branches of a tree, the bird watched the light of the fire flickering inside the hut, where the two monks conversed through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird flew high, high over the ancient  forest. For several days it flew back and forth in the sky without landing. Below stood the great tree in the ancient forest; below, the creatures of the mountain and forest were concealed by grass, bushes, and trees. Since the day the bird listened to the exchange between the two monks, its bewilderment grew. Where have I come from and where will I go? How many thousands of years will the great tree stand?\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird had heard the two monks speak about Time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Time? Why has Time brought us here, and why will it take us away? The  nut that a bird eats has its own delicious nature. How can I find out the nature of Time? The  bird wanted to pick up a small piece of Time and lie quietly with it in its nest for several days to examine its nature. Even if it took months or years to examine, the bird was willing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  bird flew high, high over the ancient forest. It was like a round balloon drifting in nothingness. The bird felt its nature was as empty as a balloon's. The emptiness of its nature was the ground of its existence, but it was also the cause of the bird's suffering. \"Time, if I could find you, certainly I could find myself,\" thought the bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several days and nights, the bird came to rest quietly in its nest. It had brought  back a tiny piece of earth from the Dai Lao forest. Deep in thought, it picked up the piece of earth to examine it. The  monk from the Dai Lao forest had said to his friend, \"Time is stilled in Eternity. There Love and Beloved are One. Each blade of grass, each piece of earth, each leaf, is one with that love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bird was still unable to find Time. The small token of earth from the Dai Lao forest revealed nothing. Perhaps the monk had lied to his friend. Time  lies in Love, but where is Love? The bird remembered the splashing water falls  endlessly  tumbling in  the  Northwest Forest. It remembered the days it listened to the sound of the waterfalls from morning to evening. The  bird had imagined itself tumbling like a waterfall.  It  played with the  light shining  on the water, with the waterfall it caressed the pebbles and rocks in the streams. In those moments, the bird felt that it was a waterfall itself, that the sound of endless falling water came from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One noon, flying across the Dai Lao Forest, the bird did not see the hut. The whole forest had burned; only a pile of ashes remained  where the monk's hut had been. In a panic, the bird flew around searching. The  monk was no longer in the forest. \"Where had he gone? Corpses of animals. Corpses of birds. Had the fire consumed the monk? The  bird was bewildered. Time,  what are you? Why do you bring us here and why will you take us away? The monk said, \"Time is stilled in Eternity.\" If that is so, perhaps Love has returned the monk to Itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the bird felt anxious. It flew swiftly back to the ancient forest. Anguished cries of many birds. Explosions. The  ancient  forest, far away, was burning.  Faster, faster still, the bird flew. The fire licked the sky. The fire spread near  the  great  tree.  Hundreds of  thousands of  birds shrieked in fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire approached the great tree. The bird fanned the fire with its wings, hoping to put it out, but the fire burned more fiercely. The bird sped to the spring, dipped its wings in the water, and rushed back to shake the water over the forest. The drops sizzled. It was not enough, not enough. The  bird's entire body soaked in water was not enough to extinguish the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cries of hundreds of thousands of birds. Screams  of young birds without feathers to fly. The fire began to burn the great tree. Why was there  no rain? Why didn't  the downpour that fell endlessly in the Northwest Forest flow like a waterfall? The bird let forth a piercing cry. The cry was tragic and passionate and was suddenly transformed into the rushing sound of a waterfall. All at once, the bird felt the fullness of its existence. Loneliness and emptiness vanished as an illusion. The image of the monk. The image of the sun behind the mountain peak. The image of rushing water falling endlessly through a thousand lifetimes. The cry of the bird was now the full sound of the waterfall. Without anxiety, the bird plunged into the forest fire like a majestic waterfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  next morning was calm. The  marvelous rays of the sun shone, but there was no symphony, no voices of tens of thousands of birds. Portions of the forest were completely burned. The great tree still stood, but more than half of its branches and leaves were charred. Corpses of large birds, corpses of small birds. The morning forest was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  birds still alive called one another, their voices be wildered. They did not know by what grace the clear sky had suddenly poured forth  rain, extinguishing  the forest fire the afternoon before. They  remembered  seeing the bird shaking water from its two wings. They knew it was the white bird from the great tree. They flew everywhere throughout the forest seeking the corpse of the white bird, but they did not find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps  the bird had flown away to live in a different forest. Perhaps  the bird had been killed by the fire. The great  tree, its body covered  with wounds, did not say a word. The birds cocked their heads to the sky and began to build new nests in the wounded  body of the great  tree. Does the great tree miss the child to which sacred mountain air and the life energy  of four  thousand  years had given birth?  Bird, where  have you gone? Listen  to the monk: I believe Time  has returned  the bird to the Love that is the source of all things.\n",

      "<p>The word satipatthana (Sanskrit: smrityupasthana) is a compound of sati, which means \"mindfulness\" or \"remembering,\" and upatthana, which means \"place of abiding,\" \"establishment,\" or \"application.\" In Chinese, the title of the sutra is Nian Chu. Nian is \"to be mindful of,\" \"to put one's attention to,\" or \"to remember.\" Chu means either \"the dwelling place\" or \"the act of dwelling,\" \"the act of being present,\" \"the act of establishing oneself.\" Nian Chu therefore may be translated as \"the Four Grounds of Mindfulness\" or \"the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>We practice mindfulness in order to realize liberation, peace, and joy in our everyday lives. Liberation and happiness are linked to each other; if there is liberation, there is happiness, and greater liberation brings greater happiness. If there is liberation, peace and joy exist in the present moment. We don't need to wait ten or fifteen years to realize them. They're available as soon as we begin the practice. However modest these elements may be, they form the basis for greater liberation, peace, and joy in the future.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To practice meditation is to look deeply in order to see into the essence of things. With insight and understanding we can realize liberation, peace, and joy. Our anger, anxiety, and fear are the ropes that bind us to suffering. If we want to be liberated from them, we need to observe their nature, which is ignorance, the lack of clear understanding. When we misunderstand a friend, we may become angry at him, and because of that, we may suffer. But when we look deeply into what has happened, we can end the misunderstanding. When we understand the other person and his situation, our suffering will disappear and peace and joy will arise. The first step is awareness of the object, and the second step is looking deeply at the object to shed light on it. Therefore, mindfulness means awareness and it also means looking deeply.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Pali word sati (Sanskrit: smrti) means \"to stop,\" and \"to maintain awareness of the object.\" The Pali word vipassana (Sanskrit: vipashyana) means \"to go deeply into that object to observe it.\" While we are fully aware of and observing deeply an object, the boundary between the subject who observes and the object being observed gradually dissolves, and the subject and object become one. This is the essence of meditation. Only when we penetrate an object and become one with it can we understand. It is not enough to stand outside and observe an object. That's why the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness reminds us to be aware of the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mind in the mind, and the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Buddha delivered the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness to an audience of monks and nuns, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. But that doesn't mean that the practice of being mindful in the ground of the Four Establishments is limited to monks and nuns. Anyone can practice mindfulness. If monks and nuns can practice mindfulness in walking, standing, lying down, and sitting, then laymen and laywomen also can. Is there anyone who does not walk, stand, lie down, and sit every day? What is most important is to understand the fundamental basis of the practice and then apply it during our everyday lives, even if our lives are different from the way the Buddha and his monks and nuns lived twenty-five centuries ago. When reading the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, we have to read with the eyes of a person of today and discover appropriate ways to practice based on the teachings of the sutra.<footnote-ref id=\"1\">1</footnote-ref></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. There are four areas of mindfulness, four areas where mindfulness has to penetrate in order for us to be protected, for joy to be nourished, for pain to be transformed, and for insight to be obtained. These are called the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. These four establishments, or foundations, are body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The First Establishment of Mindfulness is mindfulness of the body in the body. This means that when you bring mindfulness into your body, mindfulness becomes the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer. Mindfulness becomes the body, and the body becomes mindfulness. When mother embraces child, mother becomes child, and child becomes mother. In true meditation, the subject and the object of meditation no longer exist as separate entities; that distinction is removed. When you generate the energy of mindfulness and embrace your breathing and your body, that is mindfulness of the body in the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer, it is the body. The body becomes the object and the subject of mindfulness at the same time.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It's like when nuclear scientists say that to understand an elementary particle and really enter into the world of the infinitely small, you have to become a participant and not an observer anymore. In India they use the example of a grain of salt that would like to know how salty the ocean is. How can a grain of salt come to know this? The only way is for it to jump into the ocean, and the understanding will be perfect; the separation between the object of understanding and the subject of understanding is no longer there. In our time, nuclear scientists have begun to see that. That is why they say that in order to really understand the world of the elementary particle, you have to stop being an observer, you have to become a participant.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Second Establishment of Mindfulness is our feelings. The Third Establishment of Mindfulness is the mind, namely the mental formations. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha offered us four exercises of mindful breathing to take care of each of these fields of our mindfulness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Fourth Establishment of Mindfulness is the realm of perception. In the sutra it is spoken of as \"the objects of mind,\" and we can understand this as perception. The Buddha also proposed four exercises on mindful breathing for contemplation of the objects of mind in the objects of mind, so that we can penetrate, embrace, and look deeply into the object of our perception. Doing so gives us the insight that will liberate us from our delusion and our suffering.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mountains, rivers, birds, the blue sky, houses, streams, children, animals—everything is the object of your perception. And we have four exercises of mindful breathing in order to help us inquire about the true nature of all these things, including ourselves. Body is also an object of mind, feelings are also objects of our mind, and mental formations become objects of our mind. We can always inquire about the nature of our body, our feelings, or our mind, as well as our perceptions and other things. If we look deeply at the body in the body, it becomes an object of the mind. When we are looking at feelings, then feelings are the object of mind. When we are observing mind, mind becomes the object of our mind. All the establishments of mindfulness are in fact objects of mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A monk once asked me how mind can be an object of mind. I said if we take our two fingers and rub them together, then the body is in touch with the body. The mind is the same. When we look into our body, our body is the object of our mind. When we look into form, form is the object of our mind. When we look into mental formations, mental formations are the object of our mind. So we see that the field of objects of mind is very vast. But the division into four establishments is a convenient tool to help us learn how to practice mindfulness.</p>\n",

These teachings have since spread throughout the world, and the foundation of these teachings remains the practice of mindful observation. The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness has been studied, practiced, and handed down with special care from generation to generation for over 2,500 years.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The four methods of mindfulness described in the sutra are: (1) mindfulness of the body, (2) mindfulness of the feelings, (3) mindfulness of the mind, and (4) mindfulness of the objects of mind. In the establishment known as the body, the practitioner is fully aware of the breath, the positions of the body, the actions of the body, the various parts of the body, the four elements which comprise the body, and the decomposition of the body as a corpse. In the establishment known as the feelings, the practitioner is fully aware of pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings as they arise, endure, and disappear. He is aware of feelings that have a psychological basis and feelings that have a physiological basis. In the establishment known as the mind, the practitioner is fully aware of states of mind such as desire, hatred, confusion, concentration, dispersion, internal formations, and liberation. In the establishment known as the objects of mind, the practitioner is fully aware of the Five Aggregates that comprise a person (form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness), the sense organs and their objects, the factors that can obstruct understanding and liberation, the factors that can lead to awakening, and the Four Noble Truths concerning suffering and the release from suffering.</p>\n",

      "<p>As you see, the sutra is divided into six sections: Section One describes the circumstances under which the sutra was delivered and the importance of the teachings of the sutra, and it lists the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. Section Two describes the method of mindfulness of the body in the body. Section Three describes the method of mindfulness of the feelings in the feelings. Section Four describes the method of mindfulness of the mind in the mind. Section Five describes the method of mindfulness of the objects of mind in the objects of mind.

      "\n",
      "<p>The First Establishment of Mindfulness is the body, which includes the breath, the positions of the body, the actions of the body, the parts of the body, the four elements of which the body is composed, and the dissolution of the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<section level=\"3\"><exercise>Exercise 1 | Conscious Breathing</exercise></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>He goes to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged in the lotus position, holds his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He breathes in, aware that he is breathing in. He breathes out, aware that he is breathing out.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first practice is the full awareness of breathing. When we breathe in, we know that we are breathing in. When we breathe out, we know that we are breathing out. Practicing in this way, our breathing becomes conscious breathing. This exercise is simple, yet its effects are profound. To succeed, we must put our whole mind into our breathing and nowhere else. As we follow our in-breath, for example, we need to be watchful of distracting thoughts. As soon as a thought such as, \"I forgot to turn off the light in the kitchen,\" arises, our breathing is no longer conscious breathing as we are thinking about something else. To succeed, our mind needs to stay focused on our breathing for the entire length of each breath. As we breathe, our mind is one with our breath, and we become one with our breath. That is the meaning of \"mindfulness of the body in the body.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Anyone can succeed in the practice of a single conscious breath. If we continue to breathe consciously for ten breaths, without our mind going astray, then we have taken a valuable step on the path of practice. If we can practice conscious breathing for ten minutes, an important change will take place in us. How can a practice as simple as this bring about such important results and what are the results that it can bring about?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first result of conscious breathing is returning to ourselves. In everyday life, we often get lost in forgetfulness. Our mind chases after thousands of things, and we rarely take the time to come back to ourselves. When we have been lost in forgetfulness like that for a long time, we lose touch with ourselves, and we feel alienated from ourselves. This phenomenon is very common in our times. Conscious breathing is a marvelous way to return to ourselves. When we are aware of our breath, we come back to ourselves as quick as a flash of lightning. Like a child who returns home after a long journey, we feel the warmth of our hearth, and we find ourselves again. Coming back to ourselves is already a remarkable success on the path of the practice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second result of conscious breathing is that we come in contact with life in the present moment, the only moment when we can touch life. The life in us and around us is wonderful and abundant. If we're not free, we can't be in contact with it, and we're not really living our lives. We shouldn't be imprisoned by regrets about the past, anxieties for the future, or attachment and aversion in the present.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To breathe with full awareness is a miraculous way to untie the knots of regret and anxiety and to be in touch with life in the present moment. When we follow our breathing, we are already at ease, no longer dominated by our anxieties and longings. As we breathe consciously, our breath becomes more regular, and peace and joy arise and become more stable with every moment. Relying on our breathing, we come back to ourselves and are able to restore the oneness of our body and mind. This integration allows us to be in real contact with what is happening in the present moment, which is the essence of life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<section level=\"3\"><exercise>Exercise 2 | Following the Breath</exercise></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When he breathes in a long breath, he knows, 'I am breathing in a long breath.' When he breathes out a long breath, he knows, 'I am breathing out a long breath.' When he breathes in a short breath, he knows, 'I am breathing in a short breath.'When he breathes out a short breath, he knows, 'I am breathing out a short breath.'</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The practitioner follows his breathing very closely and becomes one with his breathing for the entire length of the breath, not allowing any stray thought or idea to enter. This method is called \"following the breath.\" While the mind is following the breath, the mind is the breath and only the breath. In the process of the practice, our breathing naturally becomes more regular, harmonious, and calm, and our mind also becomes more regular, harmonious, and calm. This brings about feelings of joy, peace, and ease in the body. When the mind and the breathing become one, it is only a small step for the body and mind to become one also.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<section level=\"3\"><exercise>Exercise 3 | Oneness of Body and Mind</exercise></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body. Breathing out, I am aware of my whole body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The third exercise is to bring body and mind into harmony. The element used to bring this about is the breath. In meditation practice, the distinction between body and mind dissolves, and we talk of the oneness of body and mind. In this exercise, the object of our mindfulness is no longer simply the breath, but the whole body itself, as it is unified with the breath.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Some practitioners and commentators, because they attach so much importance to the realization of the states of concentration (Pali: jhana; Sanskrit: dhyana) of the Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas, have explained the term \"whole body\" to mean the \"whole breath body\" and not the physical body of the practitioner. The Patisambhida Magga, Vimutti Magga, and Visuddhi Magga, all well-known commentaries, tell us to concentrate on the tip of our nose, the place where the air enters and goes out from the body, as we breathe. We are not told to follow our breath into our body, because the commentators fear that our body may be too large an object for us to concentrate on. This kind of reasoning has led the commentators to interpret the word \"body\" (kaya) in the sutra as \"breath body.\" But as we read the sutra, we see that the practice of being mindful of the whole \"breath body\" was already dealt with in the second exercise: \"Breathing in a long breath, he knows, 'I am breathing in a long breath.' Breathing out a short breath, he knows, 'I am breathing out a short breath.' \" Why then do we need to repeat this exercise?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first four exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing (Anapanasati) teach us to focus our attention on the body, so it is natural for the third exercise in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness (Satipatthana) also to focus on the full awareness of the physical body. Nowhere in either sutra are we taught to concentrate on the breath at the tip of the nose. Nowhere are we taught that we shouldn't concentrate on the whole physical body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In recent times, the Burmese meditation master Mahasi Sayadaw taught the method of being attentive to the inflation and contraction of the abdomen caused by the in-breath and the out-breath. Using this method, the practitioner can realize concentration easily, but it isn't described by the Mahasi as a method of awareness of breathing. The basic reason for doing this practice, according to the Mahasi, is that understanding (prajña) arises naturally when there is concentration. Perhaps the reason Mahasi Sayadaw doesn't describe this method as a practice of awareness of breathing is because of traditional prejudice that conscious breathing should not follow the breath into the body and down into the abdomen.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Here it may be useful to say something about the purpose of concentration. Right Concentration (samyak samadhi), one stage of the Noble Eightfold Path, leads to an awareness and deep observation of the object of concentration and eventually to awakened understanding. The Pali compound word samatha-vipassana (Sanskrit: samatha-vipashyana) means \"stopping-observing,\" \"calming-illuminating,\" or \"concentrating-understanding.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are also states of concentration that encourage the practitioner to escape from the complexities of suffering and existence, rather than face them directly in order to transform them. These can be called \"wrong concentration.\" The Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas are states of meditational concentration which the Buddha practiced with teachers such as Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, and he rejected them as not leading to liberation from suffering. These states of concentration probably found their way back into the sutras around two hundred years after the Buddha passed into mahaparinirvana . The results of these concentrations are to hide reality from the practitioner, so we can assume that they shouldn't be considered Right Concentration. To dwell in these concentrations for a duration of time for the sake of healing may be one thing, but to escape in them for a long time isn't what the Buddha recommended.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the third exercise, the practitioner uses her breathing to bring body and mind together as one, so the object of concentration is simultaneously body, mind, and breath. This condition, known as \"oneness of body and mind,\" is one of total integration. In our daily lives, we often find our mind and our body separated. Our body may be here, while our mind is somewhere else, perhaps lost in the distant past or floating in a distant future. Through mindfulness, we can realize the oneness of body and mind, and we're able to restore the wholeness of ourselves. In this condition, every practice will take us back to the source, which is the oneness of body and mind, and we open to a real encounter with life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When body and mind are one, the wounds in our hearts, minds, and bodies begin to heal. As long as there is separation between body and mind, these wounds can't heal. During sitting meditation, the three elements of breath, body, and mind are calmed, and gradually they become one. When peace is established in one of the three elements, the other two will soon have peace also. For example, if the body is in a very stable position and all the muscles and the nervous system are relaxed, then the mind and breath are immediately influenced, and they too gradually become calmed. Similarly, if we practice conscious breathing in the right way, our breathing becomes more regular, calm, and harmonious with every moment, and this regularity, calmness, and harmony of the breathing will spread to our body and mind, and the body and mind will benefit from it. It's only by these kinds of processes that the oneness of body and mind will be achieved. When there's oneness of body and mind, the breathing serves as \"harmonizer,\" and we realize peace, joy, and ease, the first fruits of meditation practice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<section level=\"3\"><exercise>Exercise 4 | Calming</exercise></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I calm my body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This exercise, a continuation of the third, uses the breath to realize peace and calm in our whole body. When our body is not at peace, it's hard for our mind to be at peace. Therefore, we should use our breathing to help the functions of our body be smooth and peaceful. If we're gasping for breath or if our breath is irregular, we can't calm the functions of our body. So the first thing is to harmonize our breathing. Our in-breaths and out-breaths should flow smoothly and lightly. When our breath is harmonious, our body is also. Our breath needs to be light and even and not audible. It should flow smoothly, like a small stream of water running down fine sand into the ocean. The more subtle our breath is, the more peaceful our body and mind will be. When we breathe in, we can feel the breath entering our body and calming all the cells of our body. When we breathe out, we feel the exhalation taking with it all our tiredness, irritation, and anxiety.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As we breathe, we can recite the following gatha to ourselves:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<gatha>\n",
      "<p>Breathing in, I calm my body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Breathing out, I smile.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Dwelling in the present moment,</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I know this is a wonderful moment.</p>\n",
      "</gatha>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We know that when we're meditating, body and mind are one, so we only need to calm our body in order to calm our mind. When we smile, we demonstrate the peace and joy of body and mind. Feelings of peace and joy are the nourishment of the practitioner and help the practitioner go far on the path of practice. To learn more about this, you are encouraged to practice the fifth and sixth exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. These two exercises are designed to help the practitioner nourish herself with the joy of meditational concentration. The essence of meditation practice is to come back to dwell in the present moment and to observe what is happening in the present moment. \"A wonderful moment\" means that the practitioner can see the wonders of life in her body, mind, and breathing and can make the feelings of peace and happiness stable and strong.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although we are now discussing the part of the sutra that teaches full awareness of the body in the body, since there are very close links between the body and the feelings, we should not hesitate to cross freely the boundary between the establishment of the body and the establishment of the feelings. As we already know, the peace of the body is the peace of the mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In exercises three and four, the practitioner follows the breath while returning to be one with the body and calming the whole of the body. Obviously, while practicing these breathing exercises, all your organs of sense perception—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—are closed off so that the images of the world around don't come in and agitate the peace within. To return to the body in this way is also to return to the mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From time to time, we feel tired, and everything we do or say seems to come out wrong and create misunderstanding. We may think, \"Today is not my day.\" At times like this, it's best simply to return to our body, cut off all contact, and close the doors of the senses. Following our breathing, we can collect our mind, body, and breath, and they will become one. We will have a feeling of warmth, like someone sitting inside by a fireplace while the wind and rain are raging outside. This method can be practiced anywhere at any time, not just in the meditation hall. We come back in contact with ourselves and make ourselves whole again.</p>\n",

      "<p>We shouldn't think that to close the doors of the sense perceptions is to close ourselves off from life and the world, to sever our contact with life. When we're not truly ourselves, when we're divided and dispersed, we're not really in contact with life. The contact is profound only when we are really ourselves. If we're not ourselves in the present moment, when we look at the blue sky, we don't really see the blue sky. When we hold the hand of a child, we aren't really holding the hand of a child. When we drink tea, we're not really drinking tea. Therefore, the wholeness of ourselves is the basis of any meaningful contact. We can realize the wholeness of ourselves by means of conscious breathing, which brings us back to our body and mind. Realizing the wholeness of ourselves is also to renew ourselves in every moment. We become fresh, and others enjoy being with us. When we renew ourselves, we see everything else as new. The Bamboo Forest Zen Master once said: \"Everything I touch becomes new.\"</p>\n",

When doing walking meditation in the meditation hall or outside, the practitioner can combine her breathing with her steps in order to remain steadily established in mindfulness. Before beginning any kind of walking meditation, we can recite the following gatha:</p>\n",

When he looks in front or looks behind, bends down or stands up, he also applies full awareness to what he is doing. He applies full awareness to wearing the sanghati robe or carrying the alms bowl. When he eats or drinks, chews or savors the food, he applies full awareness to all this. When passing excrement or urinating, he applies full awareness to this. When he walks, stands, lies down, sits, sleeps or wakes up, speaks or is silent, he shines his awareness on all this.</p>\n",

      "<p>This exercise is the observation and awareness of the actions of the body. This is the fundamental practice of the monk. When I was first ordained as a novice over sixty years ago, the first book my master gave me to learn by heart was a book of short verses (gathas) to be practiced while washing your hands, brushing your teeth, washing your face, putting on your clothes, sweeping the courtyard, relieving yourself, having a bath, and so on. On hearing the sound of the bell, we would breathe consciously and recite this gatha:</p>\n",

      "<p>Practicing breathing in combination with reciting a gatha helps us dwell more easily in mindfulness. Mindfulness makes every action of our body more serene, and we become master of our body and mind. Mindfulness nurtures the power of concentration in us. Many of the gathas in the book I was given, Gathas for Everyday Use, a text by Chinese master Du Ti, were taken from the Avatamsaka Sutra. I have written a book of gathas in the same spirit, Present Moment, Wonderful Moment.<footnote-ref id=\"2\">2</footnote-ref> These gathas are very easy to use and can also be combined with conscious breathing.</p>\n",

      "<p>Further, the practitioner meditates on his very own body from the soles of the feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the body: 'Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.'</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This exercise brings us into even deeper contact with our body. Here we observe the body in all its parts, from the hair on the head to the skin on the soles of the feet. In the process of our observation, we scan all the parts of the body, including the brain, heart, lungs, gall bladder, spleen, blood, urine, and so forth. The Buddha gives us the example of a farmer pouring the contents of a sack filled with a variety of seeds onto the floor and then observing and identifying each kind of seed: \"This is rice, these are beans, these are sesame seeds.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We use our conscious breathing in order to observe mindfully all the parts of the body. For example: \"Breathing in, I am aware of the hair on my head. Breathing out, I know that this is the hair on my head.\" Breathing consciously helps us dwell in mindfulness more easily and sustain the work of observing each part of the body. In addition to the conscious breathing, we can use the method of silently calling each part of the body by name to enable these parts to become increasingly clear in the light of mindfulness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Why do we need to observe in mindfulness the different parts of the body? First of all, it is to be in contact with the body. We often have the impression that we're already totally in touch with our body, but often we're wrong. Between us and our body there can be a large separation, and our body remains a stranger to us. Sometimes we hate our body. There are even people who see their body as a prison and a place of punishment. To come back to our body is to become familiar with it and to establish harmony with it. We know that if our body isn't happy, we're not happy, and so we want our body to be calm and peaceful. To do so, we come back to our body and make peace with it.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We can try touching the different parts of our body to make their acquaintance. We should touch each part in an affectionate and caring way. For several decades, our eyes, feet, and heart have done their work devotedly and faithfully with us and for us, but we never really give them much attention or express our gratitude to them. It's necessary to establish a close relationship with our body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second reason for mindfully observing the different parts of the body is that each part can be the door to liberation and awakening. At first we'll only recognize the presence of the part of the body being observed, but later we'll come to see its true nature. Every hair on our head and every cell in our body contains the entire universe. Observing the interdependent nature of a single hair can help us to see into the nature of the universe.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The exercise of observing every part of the body begins with the hair on the head and goes down to the skin on the soles of the feet. Sometimes we observe just one part of the body deeply, such as our eyes, heart, or toe. In the process of observation from the head to the feet, some observations may spring up in our mind. For example, as we pass our heart, we may think, \"My friend John has a heart condition. I must visit him soon to see if he's all right.\" We can note these observations and then continue with the work of observing the remaining parts of the body. Later we can return to those observations.</p>\n",

      "<p>Further, in whichever position his body happens to be, the practitioner passes in review the elements which constitute the body: 'In this body is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.'</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This exercise shows us the interrelationship of our body and all that is in the universe. It's one of the principal ways of witnessing for ourselves the nonself, unborn, and never-dying nature of all that is. Seeing things in this way can liberate and awaken us.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The sutra teaches us that we should be aware of the presence of earth, water, fire, and air elements in our body. These are the Four Great Elements (Sanskrit: mahabhuta), also referred to as the realms (Sanskrit: dhatu). The earth element represents the hard, solid nature of matter. The water element represents the liquid, permeating nature. The fire element represents heat, and the air element represents movement. The Dhatuvibhanga Sutra and the second version of the sutra on mindfulness in this book both refer to six elements—the two additional elements are space (Sanskrit: akasa) and consciousness (Sanskrit: vijñana).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Our bodies are more than three-fourths water. When the practitioner looks deeply in order to see the water in his body, not only does he see the liquid, permeating nature of the blood, sweat, saliva, tears, and urine, but he also sees the water element in every cell of his body. There are clouds in the body, because without clouds there can be no rain, and we won't have any water to drink or grains and vegetables to eat. We see earth in us, earth as the minerals in our body. We also see that earth is alive in us because, thanks to Mother Earth, we have food to eat. We see air in us, air representing movement. Without air we could not survive, since we, as every other species on Earth, need air to live.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The practitioner observes her body mindfully to see all that is in it and to see the interrelated nature of herself and the universe. She sees that his life is not just present in her own body, and she transcends the erroneous view that she's just her body. In the book The Sun My Heart, I refer to the sun as our second heart, a heart which lies outside our body but which is as essential for our body as the heart inside our body.<footnote-ref id=\"3\">3</footnote-ref> When the heart inside the body ceases to function, we know very well that we will die, but we often forget that if the heart outside our body, the sun, ceases to function, we will also die immediately. When we observe mindfully the interdependent nature of our body, we see our life outside our body, and we transcend the boundary between self and nonself. This practice of mindful observation helps us go beyond such limiting concepts as birth and death.</p>\n",

      "<section level=\"2\"><note>REMARKS ON THE FIRST NINE EXERCISES</note></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we practice the above nine exercises offered by the Buddha for observing the body in the body, we concentrate either on the breath, the body, the positions of the body, the actions of the body, the different parts of the body, the elements which form the body, or the decomposition of the body. When we observe the body this way, we are in direct contact with it, and we are able to see the process of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be in the constituents that comprise the body. In the first version of the sutra, at the end of each meditation exercise to observe the body in the body, we read:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is how the practitioner remains established in the observation of the body in the body, observation of the body from within or from without, or observation of the body from both within and without. He remains established in the observation of the process of coming-to-be in the body or the process of dissolution in the body or both the process of coming-to-be and the process of dissolution. Or he is mindful of the fact, 'There is a body here,' until understanding and full awareness come about. He remains established in the observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We should remember that the breathing, the positions of the body, the movements of the body, and the parts of the body all belong to the body and are the body. To be in touch with these aspects and to be able to see the process of birth and death and the nonself and interdependent nature of the body is the meaning of mindful observation of the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Therefore, the teachings of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependent origination—the three basic observations of Buddhism—are realized directly through the practice of the nine exercises for mindfully observing the body. These nine exercises can liberate and awaken us to the way things are.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the second version of the sutra, the description of each body meditation exercise is as follows:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both within and without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The words recognition, insight, clarity, and realization here mean that the practitioner recognizes, sees, sheds light on, and realizes the impermanent and interdependent nature of the body and all that is, by means of the mindful observation of the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Observing the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of all that is doesn't lead us to feel aversion for life. On the contrary, it helps us see the preciousness of all that lives. Liberation doesn't mean running away from or destroying life. Many people present Buddhism as a path that denies life, that transcends the world of the Five Aggregates (Sanskrit: skandha) of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. To present Buddhism in this way is no different from saying that the object of our practice is to arrive at the absence of life or nothingness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the Dhammacakka Sutta, the first Dharma talk given by the Buddha in the Deer Park, the Buddha taught that to be attached to existence (Sanskrit: bhava) is no worse than to be attached to nonexistence (Sanskrit: abhava). In the Kaccayana Gotta Sutta, the Buddha also taught that reality is not to be found in terms of existence or nonexistence. His meaning is perfectly clear: suffering is not brought about by life, the Five Skandhas, or the selfless and interdependent nature of all that is. The cause of ill-being is our ignorance. Because we're not able to see that the true nature of life is impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence, we become attached to things, believing that they're permanent. From this thinking arise the roots of affliction and the internal formations or knots: craving, hatred, pride, doubt, and so forth. Impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence are the essential conditions for life. Without impermanence, how can the corn seed become a corn plant and how can the baby grow up and go to school?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In fact, it's because of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence that things come into existence, mature, decay, and cease to be. Birth, decay, and ceasing to be are the necessary steps of the lives of all species. Presenting impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence as problematic, we senselessly make life unacceptable. We need to do the opposite; we need to praise them as essential elements of life. Only when we're not able to recognize these attributes as they are do we get caught in the knots of attachment and sorrow.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Ratnakuta Sutra gives the example of someone who throws a clod of earth at a dog. When the clod hits the dog, he runs after it and barks furiously at it. The dog doesn't know that the thing responsible for his pain isn't the clod of earth but the man who threw it. The sutra teaches:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the same way, the ordinary man caught in dualistic conceptions is accustomed to thinking that the Five Aggregates are the root of his suffering, but in fact the root of suffering is the lack of understanding about the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of the Five Aggregates.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Because we don't understand correctly, we become attached to things, and then we're caught by them. In the sutra, the term \"aggregate\" (Pali: khanda; Sanskrit: skandha) and the term \"aggregate of clinging\" (Pali: upadanakkhanda; Sanskrit: upadanaskandha) are used. Skandhas are the five elements that give rise to life, and the upadana skandhas are the five elements as objects of attachment. The root of suffering isn't the skandhas but the attachment that binds us. There are people who, because of their incorrect understanding of what the root of suffering is, instead of dealing with their attitude of attachment, think they have to deal with their organs of sense and the aggregates, and so they fear form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and objects of mind and feel aversion for the body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Buddha was someone who, because he wasn't attached to things, lived in peace, joy, and freedom with a healthy and fresh vigor. He always had a smile on his lips, and his presence created a fresh atmosphere around him. There are many stories in the sutras which show how much the Buddha loved life and knew how to appreciate the beautiful things around him. On many occasions, he pointed out beautiful scenery to Ananda, such as the sun setting on Vulture Peak, the golden rice fields surrounded by green paths, the fresh green landscape of the Bamboo Forest Monastery, and the lovely town of Vaisali. The Buddha was not afraid of beautiful things, because he was able to see the impermanent nature of everything, beautiful or ugly. He didn't chase after things, and he didn't run away from them either. The way of freedom isn't running away from the Five Aggregates, but coming face to face with them in order to understand their true nature.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If we cut flowers from our garden to place on the altar, that is because we acknowledge the beauty of those flowers. All we can say is, \"Although these flowers are beautiful, their beauty is fragile. When, in a few days time, these flowers die, their beauty will die with them.\" We understand this, and when the flowers wilt in a few days, we won't suffer or feel sad. Because we can see the impermanent nature of the flowers, we can appreciate all the more the beauty of each flower. To observe the impermanence of things is not to reject them, but to be in contact with them with deep understanding, without being caught in desire and attachment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Freedom in Buddhism is the freedom which comes about by being awake and understanding. A practitioner doesn't need to struggle with desire. The two basic meditation sutras, the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, both shed light on this principle: \"When his mind is desiring something, the practitioner is aware, 'My mind is desiring'\" (Satipatthana Sutta), and \"Breathing in, I am aware of the functions of my mind\" (Anapanasati Sutta). In identifying the mind of desire, in observing the nature of that mind and the nature of the object of desire, we'll see the impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence of it, and we'll no longer be dominated by that state of mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For many generations, some Buddhists have presented Buddhism as a path that destroys desire, and they have described liberated persons as emaciated arhats with wrinkled skin and no vitality. We should define what is meant by desire. If we've had nothing to eat for three days, we feel like eating. Is that desire? Is the natural desire for the indispensable elements of life a desire we need to destroy? To eat when hungry, to drink when thirsty, is that to go against the path which leads to emancipation? But if so, then Buddhism would be a path that flees from and destroys life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We know very well that to eat and drink enough are necessary to nourish our body and keep us strong. We also know that eating and drinking excessively can destroy our bodies. So we can say that to eat and drink so that the body is strong and healthy is to walk on the path of emancipation, while to eat and drink in a way that causes our body and others to suffer is to go against the way of liberation. In the first case desire isn't present, in the second case desire is present.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other Buddhists have opposed the image of the emaciated arhat destroying desire and have described liberated persons as fresh, healthy bodhisattvas, beautiful to look at and full of vigor. The image of the bodhisattva is very close to the image of the Buddha entering life with a heart of love and compassion and a smile on his lips. Although the Buddha enjoyed the solitary life, he never refused to go deeply into the world in order to help living beings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To know how to appreciate a beautiful sunset is not desire, if we \"remain established in the observation, free and not caught up in any worldly consideration\" (Satipatthana Sutta). If we are able to see impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence, we are awake. To swim in a cool stream, to drink a glass of clear water, to eat a sweet orange, and to know how to appreciate the coolness, the clarity, and the sweetness, is not desire if we are not attached to these things. In the Southern tradition of Buddhism, and to some extent in the Northern tradition, generations of Buddhists have expressed fear of peace and joy and have not dared to practice peace and joy. The tenth exercise is taken from the second version of the sutra (see Appendix). It is a practice of peace and joy.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Like the bath attendant, who, after putting powdered soap into a basin, mixes it with water until the soap paste has water in every part of it, so the practitioner feels the bliss that is born when the desires of the sense realms are put aside, saturate every part of his body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The feeling of joy that's born when the practitioner lets go of his life of agitation, desire, and hatred will strengthen and penetrate more deeply when he has mastered the way of applying his mind:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Like a spring within a mountain whose clear, pure water flows out and down all sides of that mountain and bubbles up in places where water has not previously entered, saturating the entire mountain, in the same way joy, born during concentration, permeates the whole of the practitioner's body; it is present everywhere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When the state of happiness is really present, the joy of the mind settles down to allow happiness to become steadier and deeper. For as long as the joy is still there, there goes with it, to a greater or lesser extent, conceptualization and excitement. \"Joy\" is a translation of the Sanskrit word piti, and \"happiness\" is a translation of sukha. The following example is often used to compare joy with happiness: Someone traveling in the desert who sees a stream of cool water experiences joy. When he drinks the water, he experiences happiness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Just as the different species of blue, pink, red, and white lotus, which grow up from the bottom of a pond of clear water and appear on the surface of that pond, have their tap roots, subsidiary roots, leaves, and flowers all full of the water of that pond, and there is no part of the plant which does not contain the water, so the feeling of happiness which arises with the disappearance of joy permeates the whole of the practitioner's body, and there is no part which it does not penetrate.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>At the time of the meditation, the practitioner feels happy and at peace. He lets his consciousness of this peace and happiness embrace his whole body, so that his body is saturated by it:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Just as someone who puts on a very long robe which reaches from his head to his feet, and there is no part of his body which is not covered by this robe, so the practitioner with a clear, calm mind envelops his whole body in understanding and leaves no part of the body uncovered. This is how the practitioner is aware of the body as the body, both within and without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of the body as the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As we've already seen, the function of this exercise is to nourish us with joy and happiness and to heal the wounds within us. But we have no doubts about letting go of this joy in order to embark on the work of observation. Joy and happiness come about because of physical and psychological conditions and are as impermanent as all other physical and psychological phenomena. Only when, thanks to mindful observation, we realize the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of all that is, can we achieve freedom and liberation.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Whenever the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, he is aware, 'I am experiencing a pleasant feeling.' Whenever he has a painful feeling, he is aware, 'I am experiencing a painful feeling.'Whenever he experiences a feeling which is neither pleasant nor painful, he is aware, 'I am experiencing a neutral feeling.'</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are three sorts of feelings: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. The teaching of this exercise is to identify and be in touch with these feelings as they arise, endure, and fade away.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When there is an unpleasant feeling, the practitioner is not in a hurry to chase it away. She comes back to her conscious breathing and observes, \"Breathing in, I know that an unpleasant feeling has arisen within me. Breathing out, I know that this unpleasant feeling is present in me.\" Whenever there is a pleasant or a neutral feeling, she practices mindful observation in accordance with that feeling. She knows that her feeling is her, and that for the moment she is that feeling. She is neither drowned in nor terrorized by that feeling, nor does she reject it. This is the most effective way to be in contact with feelings. If we call a pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feeling by its name, we identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go (Pali: upekkha, Sanskrit: upeksa) and is an important part of meditation practice. Letting go is one of the Four Unlimited Minds (Sanskrit: brahmavihara), which are love, compassion, joy, and letting go.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A person is comprised of the Five Aggregates—form (the body), feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Each aggregate is a river. Our body is a river in which every cell is a drop of water, and all of them are in constant transformation and movement. There is also a river of feelings in us, in which every feeling is a drop of water. Each of these feelings—pleasant, unpleasant, neutral—relies on all other feelings to be born, mature, and disappear. To observe the feelings is to sit on the bank of the river of feelings and identify each feeling as it is arises, matures, and disappears.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Our feelings usually play an important part in directing our thoughts and our mind. Our thoughts arise and become linked to each other around the feelings that are present. When we are mindful of our feeling, the situation begins to change. The feeling is no longer the only thing present in us, and it is transformed under the light of our awareness. Therefore, it no longer sweeps us along the way it did before there was mindfulness of the feeling. If we continue to observe the feeling mindfully, we will be able to see its substance and its roots. This empowers the observer. When we are able to see the nature of something, we are able to transcend it and not be led astray or corrupted by it anymore.</p>\n",

      "<p>This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 11 and has the capacity to help us see the roots and the substance of the feelings we have. Our feelings—pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral—can have a physical, physiological, or psychological root. When we mindfully observe our feelings, we discover their roots. For example, if you have an unpleasant feeling because you stayed up late the night before, your unpleasant feeling has a physiological root. Nevertheless, to be able to identify the roots of your feelings is not enough. We have to look more deeply in order to see how these feelings manifest and to understand their true substance. To know a feeling is not just to see its roots but also to see its flowering and its fruits.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When some people take a sip of whiskey or inhale from a cigarette, for example, they may have a pleasant feeling. If they observe this feeling mindfully, they can see its physiological and psychological roots. We know that not everyone shares the same pleasant feeling when they drink whiskey or smoke cigarettes. If some other people were to do either of these two things, they may cough or choke, and the feeling would be unpleasant. Thus the roots of that feeling are not as simple as they might appear at first. The elements of habit, time, and our own psychology and physiology are all present in the roots of any feeling. Looking into our feeling, we can see physiological, physical, and psychological habits; not only our own habits, but also those of the society whose products we are consuming.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Looking into our feeling, we see the nature of whiskey and the nature of tobacco. Looking into the glass of whiskey, we can see the grains that are needed for its production. We can see the effect that the alcohol will have on our body now and in the near future. We can see the connection between the consumption of alcohol and car accidents. We can see the link between the consumption of alcohol and the severe lack of food in the world. We have squandered a large amount of grains in producing alcohol and meat, while in many places in the world, children and adults are dying for want of grain to eat. An economist at the University of Paris once said: \"If the western world were to consume fifty percent less alcohol and meat, the problem of starvation in the world could be solved.\" If we look into any one thing with the eyes of mindful observation, we can see the roots and the results of it. If we mindfully observe a feeling, we can see the roots of that feeling and the results it is likely to produce. The mindful observation of a feeling can lead to a deep insight into the nature of life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we hear someone praise us, we may have a pleasant feeling. That pleasant feeling also needs to be examined. Obviously we have the right to accept a pleasant feeling, but we know that in our meditation practice we need to observe mindfully in order to have clear insight into the nature of our feeling. If in our mindful observation, we see that those words of praise were based in flattery rather than reality, then we discover that our pleasant feeling arose out of ignorance and self-love. Such a pleasant feeling can take us farther along the path of illusion. When we see that, the pleasant feeling disappears, and we come back to the ground of reality with both feet planted firmly. The danger of being deluded no longer exists, and we become healthy again. The pleasant feeling we have when we drink alcohol will also disappear when we see its roots and its effects. When pleasant feelings like this disappear, they can give rise to pleasant feelings of another kind, such as the awareness that we are now living in a way that leads to health and awakened understanding. Pleasant feelings of the second kind are healthy because they nourish us and others and cause no harm.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Even though we feel that the words of praise are in harmony with the truth, we should continue to observe the pleasant feeling brought about by those words of praise. The work of mindful observation helps us avoid pride or arrogance—the two things which above all obstruct our progress on the path. We see that if we keep on with what we have started, we will make additional progress, and the words of praise, instead of making us proud or arrogant, become elements of encouragement for us. If we observe mindfully like that, the pleasant feeling on hearing words of praise becomes a healthy feeling and has a nourishing effect.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we observe our feelings, we can see their relative nature. It is our way of seeing the world that determines the nature of our feelings. One person while working might feel that work is nothing but agony, and he will only feel happy when he is not working. There are other people, however, who feel uneasy when they have nothing to do and would be happy with any work rather than doing nothing. In the latter case, work brings joy, a pleasant feeling, while in the former case, work gives rise to unpleasant feelings, such as boredom or drudgery. Often we do not see that we have all the conditions necessary for happiness, and we go looking for happiness in another place or in the future. To be able to breathe can be a great source of real happiness, but often, unless we have a congested nose or asthma, we are not able to realize that. To be able to see beautiful colors and forms is happiness, but often only after we have lost our sight do we become aware of this. Having sound and healthy limbs to be able to run and jump, living in an atmosphere of freedom, not being separated from our family—all these things and thousands more can be elements of happiness. But we rarely remember, and happiness slips from our grasp as we chase other things which we believe to be necessary for our happiness. Generally, only after we lose an element of happiness do we appreciate it. Awareness of these precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of Right Mindfulness. We can use conscious breathing to shine light on their presence:</p>\n",

      "<p>Peace, joy, and happiness are above all the awareness that we have the conditions for happiness. Thus mindfulness is the basic and essential ingredient for happiness. If you do not know that you are happy, it means that you are not happy. Most of us only remember that not having a toothache is happiness at the time when we have a toothache. We are not aware of the joy of our non-toothache, because we do not practice mindfulness.</p>\n",

      "<p>When roots of affliction such as anger, confusion, jealousy, and anxiety manifest in us, our body and mind are generally disturbed by them. These psychological feelings are unpleasant, and they agitate the functioning of our body and mind. We lose our peace, joy, and calm. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha teaches us to take hold of our breathing in order to produce awareness of the unpleasant feeling and gradually to master it: \"Breathing in, I know that I have an unpleasant feeling. Breathing out, I am clearly aware of this unpleasant feeling.\" If our breathing is light and calm (a natural result of practice), then our mind and body will slowly become light, calm, and clear again: \"Breathing in, I calm the feelings in me. Breathing out, I calm the feelings in me.\" In this way, the practitioner continues to use conscious breathing to mindfully observe and calm his feelings. Every time she sees the substance, roots, and effects of her feelings, she is no longer under the control of those feelings. The whole character of our feelings can change just by the presence of mindful observation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Fear and anger are fields of energy that arise from a physiological or psychological base. The unpleasant feelings that arise within us are also fields of energy. The Buddha teaches us not to repress fear or anger, or the unpleasant feelings brought about by them, but to use our breathing to be in contact with and accept these feelings, knowing that they are energies that originate in our psychological or physiological make-up. To repress our feelings is to repress ourselves. Mindful observation is based on the principle of nonduality. Our unpleasant feelings and ourselves are one. We have to be in contact with and accept the unpleasant feelings before we can transform them into the kinds of energy that are healthy and have the capacity to nourish us. We have to face our unpleasant feelings with care, affection, and nonviolence. Our unpleasant feelings can illuminate so much for us. By our work of mindful observation, we see that experiencing certain unpleasant feelings allows us insight and understanding.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Both in the sutras and the sastras (the commentaries on the sutras), the ancestral teachers say the painful, unpleasant feelings are easier to recognize than the neutral feelings. But in fact, neutral feelings are also easy to recognize. They are not suffering feelings and they are not happy feelings. In us there is a river of feelings, and every drop of water in that river is either a suffering feeling, a happy feeling, or a neutral feeling. Sometimes we have a neutral feeling and we think we don't have a feeling at all. But a neutral feeling is a feeling; it doesn't mean the nonexistence of feeling.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we have a toothache, we have a feeling of pain, and when the toothache is no longer there, we think we don't have a feeling anymore. But in fact, we have a neutral feeling. It's not a painful feeling, so it must be either neutral or pleasant. Actually, it can be a pleasant feeling. When we have a very bad toothache, we just wish it would stop. We know if it were to stop, we would have a very pleasant feeling. Therefore, a non-toothache is a pleasant feeling. But once the toothache has been gone for some time, we no longer appreciate our non-toothache. We could call it a neutral feeling, but with awareness it can become a pleasant feeling. In Plum Village, we usually say someone who practices mindfulness can change all neutral feelings into pleasant feelings. In fact, neutral feelings are the majority of our feelings.</p>\n",

      "<p>For example, a father and son are sitting on the lawn in springtime. The father is practicing mindful breathing and he sees how wonderful it is to sit on the grass, feeling fresh and happy, with the yellow flowers coming up and the birds singing; so he has pleasant feelings. But the child is bored, he doesn't want to sit with his father. He's in exactly the same environment as his father. To begin with his feeling is neutral, and at some point the neutral feeling becomes an unpleasant feeling, because he doesn't know how to deal with this neutral feeling. So, wanting to run away from his unpleasant feeling, he stands up and goes into the house and turns on the television. But his father is feeling very content sitting in that same environment that was not able to bring happiness to the son.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We're the same. When we don't have a pleasant or unpleasant feeling, naturally we have a neutral feeling. If we don't know how to deal with or manage our neutral feeling, it will turn into an unpleasant feeling. However, if we know how to manage it, it will become a pleasant feeling, a feeling of well-being. Every neutral feeling, when held in mindfulness, will become a pleasant feeling.</p>\n",

      "<p>The Third Establishment of Mindfulness presented in the sutra is the establishment of the mind. The contents of the mind are the psychological phenomena called mental formations (cittasamskara). Feelings are also mental formations, but they were dealt with on their own in the Second Establishment of Mindfulness, because the sphere of feelings is so wide. What remains are all the other psychological phenomena, such as perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. These are all mind functions and are the objects of our mindful observation of the mind in the mind. Formations can be either mental, physical, or physiological.</p>\n",

      "<p>Different schools of Buddhism list different numbers of mental formations. The Abhidharmakosa School lists forty-six, the Satyasiddhi School lists forty-nine, and the Dharmalaksana School lists fifty-one. The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness lists only twenty-eight mental formations, including desire, anger, ignorance, disturbance, narrowness, limitedness, lack of concentration, lack of freedom, dullness and drowsiness, agitation and remorse, doubt; their opposites: not-desiring, not-hating, non-ignorance, non-disturbance, tolerance, unlimitedness, concentration, freedom, absence of doubt, absence of dullness and drowsiness, absence of agitation; as well as mindfulness, distaste, peace, joy, ease, and letting go. The second version of the sutra lists one additional mental formation, impurity, which could include other mental formations that are considered to be defilements. The third version considers sensual craving as a formation separate from desire. Any of these mental formations can be the object of our mindful observation of the mind in the mind.</p>\n",

      "<p>The exercise of observing the mind in the mind isn't different from observing the body in the body or observing the feelings in the feelings.

We recognize them and look deeply into them in order to see their substance, their roots in the past, and their possible fruits in the future, using conscious breathing while we observe. We should remember that when the lamp of mindfulness is lit up, the mental formation under observation will naturally transform in a wholesome direction.</p>\n",

Form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are the objects of the five kinds of sense desire, which are desire for money, sex, fame, good food, and sleep. These five categories of desire produce obstacles on the path of practice as well as many kinds of physical and mental suffering.</p>\n",

      "<p>Whenever the practitioner's mind and thoughts turn to desiring, she immediately gives rise to awareness of the presence of that mind. \"This is a mind longing for wealth.

      "<p>The Buddha often said that many people confuse desire with happiness. In the Magandiya Sutra (Majjhima Nikaya 75), a man who is forced to live in the forest because he has leprosy, suffering from severe itching and stinging. He dug a hole, filled it with dry branches and logs, and set them on fire. When the fire became red-hot charcoal, he stood at the edge of the hole and stretched his arms and legs out over it to catch the heat. When he did this, his suffering was relieved. On days when he could not make a charcoal fire to warm himself, his itching was unbearable. Miraculously, some years later, he was cured of the disease and went back to live in the village.</p>\n",

      "<p>One day he went into the forest and saw a number of lepers dragging their bodies to warm themselves by a charcoal fire, and he felt tremendous pity for them. The charcoal was extremely hot, he couldn't go near it. If someone had dragged him to the hole to warm his body over the charcoal, his suffering would have been great. That which in former times had brought him happiness and relief was now a source of agony. The Buddha said, \"Desire is also just a hole of burning charcoal in the forest. Only those who are sick look on desire as happiness.\" Before he became a monk, the Buddha had tasted a life of trying to satisfy the five desires, so his words came from experience. True happiness, he said, is a life with few desires, few possessions, and the time to enjoy the many wonders in us and around us.</p>\n",

      "<p>The scriptures record how the monk Baddhiya tasted happiness and ease when he observed his life of no desire. One night while sitting in meditation at the foot of a tree in the Bamboo Forest Monastery, Baddhiya suddenly twice called out the words, \"O happiness!\" The next morning, another bhikkhu reported this to the Buddha, thinking that the monk Baddhiya regretted losing the high position he had had when he was a governor. That afternoon after the Dharma talk, the Buddha summoned Baddhiya and asked, \"Is it true that yesterday during your meditation you called out twice, 'O happiness!'?\" Baddhiya replied, \"Venerable Sir, it is true that last night I called out twice, 'O happiness!'\"</p>\n",

Now as a bhikkhu, I go into the forest on my own, sit alone at the foot of a tree, sleep alone without a curtain or a mat, and I never have any feelings of unease or fear. I feel a great sense of ease, joy, and peace that I never felt when I was a governor. I do not fear assassins or thieves, because I have nothing to be stolen or fought over. I live at ease like a deer in the forest. During last night's meditation, I felt clearly that feeling of ease, and that is why I raised my voice and called out twice, 'O happiness!' If I disturbed any of my fellow practitioners, I sincerely apologize, Venerable Sir.\"</p>\n",

Simplicity is to have few desires and to be content with just a few possessions. Desirelessness is the basis of true happiness, because in true happiness there must be the elements of peace, joy, and ease.</p>\n",

      "<p>When anger is present in him, he is aware, 'Anger is present in me.' When anger is not present in him, he is aware, 'Anger is not present in me.' When anger begins to arise, he is aware of it. When already arisen anger is abandoned, he is aware of it. When anger already abandoned will not arise again in the future, he is aware of it.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This exercise is to observe our anger in mindfulness. In Buddhism, we learn that a person is comprised of the Five Aggregates of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Anger belongs to the aggregate of mental formations, and the unpleasant feeling that goes along with the anger belongs to the aggregate of feelings. The mastery of our anger is an important step on the path of practice. Identifying the presence and the absence of anger in us brings many benefits. For our work of mindful observation to be wholehearted, we combine the work of observation with conscious breathing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is that we see that when anger is not present, we are much happier. Anger is like a flame blazing up and consuming our self-control, making us think, say, and do things that we will probably regret later. The actions of body, speech, and mind that we perform while we're angry take us a long way along the road to hell. We may never have seen the Avici hells, but we can see clearly that whenever someone is angry, he is abiding in one of the hot hells. Anger and hatred are the materials of which the Avici hells are made. A mind without anger—cool, fresh, and sane—is one of the eleven wholesome mental formations. The absence of anger is the basis of real happiness, the basis of love and compassion.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is that by just identifying our anger, it loses some of its destructive nature. Only when we're angry and not observing our anger mindfully does our anger become destructive. When anger is born in us, we should follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger. When we do that, mindfulness has already been born in us, and anger can no longer monopolize our consciousness. Awareness stands alongside the anger: \"I know that I am angry.\" This awareness is a companion for the anger. Our mindful observation is not to suppress or drive out our anger, but just to look after it. This is a very important principle in meditation practice. Mindful observation is like a lamp that gives light. It's not a judge. It throws light on our anger, sponsors it, looks after it in an affectionate and caring way, like an older sister looking after and comforting her younger sibling.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we're angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase away our anger is to suppress or chase away ourselves. When we're joyful, we are joy. When we're angry, we are anger. When we love, we are love. When we hate, we are hatred. When anger is born, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can change that energy into another kind of energy. If we want to transform it, first we have to know how to accept it. For example, a garbage can filled with decomposing and smelly organic material can be transformed into compost and later into beautiful roses. At first, we may see the garbage and the flowers as separate and opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the garbage, and the garbage already exists in the flowers. The beautiful rose contains the garbage in it; if we look carefully, we can see that. It only takes one week for a flower to become garbage. The smelly garbage already contains beautiful flowers and fragrant herbs, such as coriander and basil. When a good organic gardener looks into the garbage can, she can see that, and so she does not feel sad or disgusted. Instead, she values the garbage and doesn't discriminate against it. It takes only a few months for garbage to transform into fragrant herbs and flowers. We also need the insight and nondual vision of the organic gardener with regard to anger and despair. We need not be afraid of them or reject them. We know that anger is a kind of garbage, but that it's within our power to transform it. We need it in the way the organic gardener needs compost. If we know how to accept our anger, we already have some peace and joy. Gradually we can transform anger completely.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When anger arises, other mental formations, which are lying latent in the depths of our consciousness, are not arising. This deep consciousness is called alaya by the Vijñanavada school. Joy, sadness, love, and hate, for example, are present in alaya when we are angry, but they are lying beneath the surface without manifesting, like seeds (Sanskrit: bija) in the ground. If we let the anger express itself without giving it a sponsor, it can do a lot of damage inside and outside of us. When the mental formation mindfulness arises from alaya, it can become the spiritual friend of the mental formation anger. As we follow our breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness, the situation becomes less and less dangerous. Although the anger is still there, it gradually loses its strength and begins to transform into another kind of energy, like love or understanding.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mindfulness is like a lamp illuminating ourselves. As soon as the lamp is brought into the room, the room changes. When the sun rises, the light of the sun only has to shine onto the plants for them to change, grow, and develop. The light of the sun appears not to be doing anything at all, but in truth it is doing a lot. Under the influence of the sun, the plants produce chlorophyll and become green. It is thanks to the growth of plants that the animal species have what they need to survive. If the sun keeps shining on the bud, the flower will open. When the light of the sun penetrates the flower bud, the photons transform it, and the flower opens. Our mindfulness has the same function as the light of the sun. If we shine the light of full awareness steadily on our state of mind, that state of mind will transform into something better.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Thanks to the illuminating light of awareness, we can see the roots of our anger. The point of meditation is to look deeply into things in order to be able to see their nature. The nature of things is interdependent origination, the true source of everything that is. If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding (or ignorance), clumsiness (or lack of skill), the surrounding society, hidden resentment, and habit (or our conditioning). These roots can be present both in ourselves and in the person who played the principal role in allowing the anger to arise. We observe mindfully in order to be able to see and to understand. Seeing and understanding are the elements of liberation that allow us to be free of the suffering which always accompanies anger. Seeing and understanding bring about love and compassion. They are the balm of the bodhisattva's compassion that cools our hearts and mind. As we have already seen, our anger is a field of energy. Thanks to our mindful observation and insight into its roots, we can change this energy into the energy of love and compassion—a constructive and healing energy.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Usually when people are angry, they say and do things that cause damage to others and themselves. There are people who speak and act in ways that wound others. They believe that doing so will release the field of angry energy that is burning in their hearts. They shout and scream, beat things, and shoot poisoned arrows of speech at others. These methods of release are dangerous.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Sometimes people try to find ways to express their anger in a less dangerous way. They may go into their room, close the door behind them, and pound a pillow with all their might. Naturally if you beat a pillow until your energy is exhausted, your anger will subside, and you'll probably experience a temporary feeling of relief—exhaustion is easier to bear than anger—but the roots of the anger remain untouched, and when the conditions are right, the same anger will arise again. Therefore, the method of mindful observation in order to see and to understand the roots of our anger is the only method that has lasting effectiveness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As we've seen already, when anger arises, we first need to come back to our conscious breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness. We concentrate on our breathing in order to maintain mindfulness. We avoid listening to or looking at the person whom we regard as the cause of our anger. Usually when we're angry, we don't return to ourselves and take care of healing our anger. We want to think about the hateful aspects of the person who has made us angry—rudeness, dishonesty, cruelty, maliciousness, and so on. The more we think of them, listen to them, or look at them, the more our anger flares up. Their hatefulness may be real, imaginary, or exaggerated, but whatever it is that's making us angry, we're inclined to give our full attention to that. In fact, the root of our problem is the anger inside of us, and we have to come back to it and take care of it first of all. Like a firefighter, we must put water on the blaze immediately and not waste time looking for the person who set the house on fire. \"Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must take care of my anger.\" So it's best not to listen to, look at, or think about the other person, or to say or do anything as long as anger persists. If we put our mind into the work of observing and calming our anger, we'll avoid creating damage that we would probably regret later. We may like to go outside and practice walking meditation. The fresh air, green trees, and the plants will help us greatly. As we walk, we can recite this verse:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<meditation-verse>\n",
      "<p>Breathing in, I know that anger is still here.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>Mindfulness embraces the feeling, as a mother holds her crying child in her arms and transmits all her affection and care. If a mother puts all her heart and mind into caring for her baby, the baby will feel the mother's gentleness and will calm down. In the same way, we can calm the functioning of our mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In order to lessen the unpleasant feeling brought about by the anger, we give our whole heart and mind to the practice of walking meditation, combining our breath with our steps and giving full attention to the contact between the soles of our feet and the earth. After a while, our anger will calm down, and we become stronger. Then we can begin to observe the anger and its true nature.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We know that we can't eat potatoes without cooking them first. We fill our pot with water, put the lid on, and light the fire. The lid of the pot, which keeps the heat inside, is the power of concentration—not to speak, not to listen, not to do anything at all, but just to concentrate our whole mind on our breathing. As soon as the pot is on the fire, the water begins to get warm. When we practice conscious breathing, although our anger is still there, it's accompanied by mindfulness, the fire under the potatoes. The anger—the potatoes—has started to transform. Half an hour later, the potatoes are cooked, and our anger is transformed. We can smile, and we know that we understand the roots of our anger, and we can face the person who precipitated it.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Our anger is rooted in our lack of understanding of ourselves and of the causes, deep-seated as well as immediate, which have brought about this unpleasant state of affairs. Anger is also rooted in desire, pride, agitation, and suspiciousness. Our method of dealing with events as they arise reflects our state of understanding as well as our state of confusion. The chief roots of our anger are in ourselves. Our environment and other people are only secondary roots.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We can put up with the damage brought about by an earthquake or a flood, but if people had caused the same damage, we might not show much patience, and anger and hatred may arise in us. But if we know that earthquakes and floods have causes, we should also be able to see that there are causes—deep-seated or immediate—of the harm done to us by people. We need to see and understand these causes also. We have to see hardships brought about by others as a sort of natural disaster. These people make our lives difficult because they're ignorant, prisoners of their desires or their hatreds. If we speak angrily to them and treat them as our enemy, then we're just doing what they are doing, and we're no different from them. In order to realize the state of no anger in our conscious and subconscious mind, we have to practice the meditations on love and compassion.</p>\n",

      "<p>In the Anguttara Nikaya (V, 161), the Buddha teaches, \"If a mind of anger arises, the bhikkhu can practice the meditation on love, on compassion, or on equanimity for the person who has brought about the feeling of anger.\" Love meditation is a method for developing the mind of love and compassion. Love (Pali: metta; Sanskrit: maitri) is a mind that is intent on bringing peace, joy, and happiness to others. Compassion (Sanskrit: karuna) is a mind that is intent on removing the suffering which is present in others. That is the meaning of the phrase, \"Love is the capacity to give joy. Compassion is the power to relieve suffering.\" When love and compassion are sources of energy in us, they bring peace, joy, and happiness to those dear to us and to others also.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We all have the seeds of love and compassion in us, and we can develop these fine and wonderful sources of energy. Maitri and karuna aren't the kinds of love that try to possess and appropriate, to dictate and bring about suffering for ourselves and those we love. Maitri and karuna are the kinds of unconditional love that don't expect anything in return. Consequently they don't result in anxiety, boredom, or sorrow.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The essence of love and compassion is understanding, the ability to recognize the suffering of others. We have to be in touch with the physical, material, and psychological suffering of others. To do so, we have to put ourselves \"inside the skin\" of the other. We must \"go inside\" their body, feelings, and mental formations and experience their suffering. A shallow observation as an outsider won't help us see their suffering. In the Satipatthana Sutta, we're taught to be one with the object of our observation. We observe the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mental formations in the mental formations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we're in contact with the suffering of another, a feeling of compassion is born in us immediately. Compassion literally means \"to suffer with\" the other. Looking in order to see the suffering in another person is the work of meditation. If we sit cross-legged, follow our breathing, and observe someone mindfully, we can be in contact with his suffering, and the energy of compassion arises in us. We can also do this while walking, standing, lying down, sitting, speaking, and acting, not just when we are sitting in meditation. The physical and psychological suffering of that person will be clear to us in the light of our mindful observation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When the mind of compassion arises, we have to find ways to nourish and express it. When we come into contact with the other person, our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion, even if that person says and does things that are not easy to accept. We practice in this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person apologizing or being lovable. Then we can be sure that our mind of compassion is firm and authentic. We'll recognize in ourselves some of the beautiful signs of the compassionate mind: (1) our sleep is more relaxed, (2) we do not have nightmares, (3) our waking-state is more at ease, (4) we're not anxious or depressed, and (5) we're protected by everyone and everything around us. The person who has been the object of our meditation on compassion will also, eventually, benefit from our meditation. His suffering will slowly diminish, and his life will gradually be brighter and more joyful.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We can begin our meditation on compassion with someone who is undergoing suffering of a physical or material kind—someone who is weak and easily ill, poor, or oppressed, or has no protection. This kind of suffering is easy to see. We observe it deeply, either during sitting meditation or when we're actually in contact with it. We must have enough time if we're going to be in deep contact with the suffering of that person. We have to observe until the mind of compassion arises, and the substance of the mind of compassion penetrates into our being. Then the mind of compassion will envelop the object of our observation. If we observe deeply in this way, the mind of compassion will naturally be transformed into action. We won't just say, \"I love her very much,\" but instead, \"I must do something so that she'll suffer less.\" The mind of compassion is truly present when it has the capacity of removing suffering.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After that, we can practice being in contact with more subtle forms of suffering. Sometimes the other person doesn't seem to be suffering at all, but we may notice that she has sorrows which have left their marks in hidden ways. Someone with more than enough material comforts can also be subject to suffering. There are very few people who are not suffering to some degree. The person who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to sit down, follow our breathing, and look deeply, and naturally we'll see her suffering.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We may be able to see how her misery has come about because of the lack of skill of the parents who raised her. But her parents may have been the victims of their parents. The suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation, and it has been reborn in her. If we can see that, we'll no longer blame her for making us suffer, because we understand the way in which she is also a victim. To look deeply is to understand. Once we understand, it's easy to embrace the other person in our mind of compassion.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To look deeply into the suffering of those who have caused us to suffer is a miraculous gift. Thanks to our observation, we now know that the person is suffering. He may think that his suffering will be lessened if he can cause us to suffer. Once we're in touch with his suffering, our enmity and bitterness towards him will vanish, and we'll long for him to suffer less. The spring water of the compassionate mind begins to flow, and we ourselves are the first to be cleansed by it. We feel cool and light, and we can smile. We don't need two people to bring about reconciliation. When we look deeply, we become reconciled with ourselves and, for us, the problem no longer exists. Sooner or later, the other will see our attitude and share in the freshness of the stream of love which is flowing naturally in our heart.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After we experience the fruit of the meditation of compassion, the meditation on love becomes relatively easy. Just as with the mind of compassion, the mind of love brings peace, joy, and happiness to the practitioner first. We know that if we don't have peace and joy ourselves, we won't have peace and joy to share with others. That's why the meditation on compassion and the meditation on love bring benefits both to the practitioner and to others.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we reduce the suffering in others, we also bring them happiness at the same time. Although life is suffering, it also has many wonderful things like the early morning sky, the harvest moon, the forsythia bush, the violet bamboo, the stream of clear water, and the beautiful child. When we pay attention only to our suffering, we're not able to make contact with these wonderful things, and anything we say or do will not untie the knot of suffering and bring about the conditions for living joyfully. Mindful observation is the element that nourishes the tree of understanding, and compassion and love are the most beautiful flowers. When we realize the mind of love, we have to go to the one who has been the object of our mindful observation, so that our mind of love is not just an object of our imagination but is a source of energy that has an effect in the real world.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Buddha teaches that during our meditation we can send our mind of love and compassion into the four directions and embrace all species of living beings. But we must be careful not to think that the meditations of love and compassion consist in just sitting still and imagining that our mind of love and compassion will spread out into space like waves of sound or light. Sound and light have the ability to penetrate everywhere, and love and compassion can do the same. But if our love and compassion are only a kind of imagining—for example, if we imagine they are like a pure white cloud that slowly forms and gradually spreads out and out to envelop the whole world—then they'll have no effect; they're only a cloud of the imagination. A true cloud can produce rain. It's only in the midst of our daily life and in our actual contact with people and other species, including the object of our meditation, that we can know whether our mind of love and compassion is really present and whether it is stable. If love and compassion are real, they'll be evident in our daily life, in the way we talk with people and the way we act in the world. The sitting meditation position is not the only position in which we can give rise to the spring water of love and compassion.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Many people think that if they don't have influence and money, they can't realize love and compassion. In fact, the source of love and compassion is in us, and we can help many people suffer less and realize a lot of happiness without being rich or influential. One word, one action, or one thought can reduce another person's suffering and bring him joy. One word can give comfort and confidence, destroy doubt, help someone avoid a mistake, reconcile a conflict, open the door to liberation, or show him the way to success and happiness. One action can save a person's life or help him take advantage of a rare opportunity. One thought can do the same, because thoughts lead to words and action. If love and compassion are in our hearts, every thought, word, and deed can bring about a miracle. Because understanding is the very foundation of love and compassion, the words and actions engendered by love and compassion will be ones that are helpful. When we want to help, we know how to avoid the kind of love that does more harm than good. We must always remember that love is none other than understanding.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Ignorance, or delusion, is the erroneous perception of things. In order to correct our erroneous perceptions, the Buddha teaches us a method of discriminative investigation, which relates to the establishment of the mind and the establishment of the objects of mind. The objects of mind are also called dharmas (all that can be conceived of as existing). They include the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses. The six sense organs are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The six sense objects are form and color, sound, smell, taste, tactile objects, and mind-objects (every concept and every thing that belongs to the sphere of memory and mental experience). The sense six consciousnesses are: eye-consciousness (or sight), ear-consciousness (or hearing), nose-consciousness (or smelling), taste-consciousness (or tasting), body-consciousness (or touching), and mind-consciousness. All dharmas are contained within these Eighteen Realms (Sanskrit: dhatu), which include all psychological, physiological, and physical aspects. All Eighteen Realms are also called objects of mind, including mental formations. When mind is observing mind, the mind becomes an object of mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The basic characteristic of all dharmas is interdependent origination. All dharmas arise, endure, and fade away according to the law of interdependence. In the Majjhima Nikaya, it is taught: \"This is, because that is; this is not, because that is not. This is produced, because that is produced. This is destroyed, because that is destroyed.\" The Buddhist principle of interdependence, put forward with the utmost simplicity, is immeasurably deep. According to this teaching, no single dharma can arise by itself, endure by itself, and fade away by itself. The coming-to-be of one dharma is dependent on the coming-to-be, endurance, and destruction of other dharmas, in fact, of all other dharmas. Dharmas do not have independent existence. They're empty of a separate, independent existence.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In our daily life, we're inclined to perceive things as real and independent of each other. Take, for example, a leaf we see on the branch in front of us. We may think that this leaf exists independently of all the other leaves, independently of the branch, the trunk, and the roots of the tree; independently of the clouds, the water, the earth, and the sky. In truth, this leaf could not be here without the presence of all the other things that we see as different from it. This leaf is one with the other leaves, the branch, the trunk, and the roots of the tree; with the clouds, the river, the earth, the sky, and the sunlight. If any one of these things were not present, the leaf could not be. If we look deeply into the leaf, we can see the presence of all these things. The leaf and these things are present together. This is the principle of interbeing and interpenetration, the principle of one is all and all is one, which the Avatamsaka Sutra, the most complete and sufficient expression of the Buddhist principle of interdependent origination, teaches. Things do not exist outside of each other. Things exist within each other and with each other. That is why the Buddha said: \"This is, because that is.\" With the power of concentration, we can observe all that is in the light of this principle. All phenomena in the universe, including the thoughts, words, and feelings of both ourselves and those around us, need to be observed in the light of interdependence.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This method of discriminative investigation begins by classifying the dharmas into categories like the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses, namely, the Eighteen Realms, which can also be classified according to the Five Aggregates of form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. By \"form,\" we mean all physiological and physical phenomena. \"Feelings\" means pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. \"Perceptions\" means basic conceptualizations and naming. \"Mental formations\" means psychological states that arise and manifest in us. \"Consciousness\" is the function of maintaining, cognizing, comparing, storing, and remembering all the seeds. The basic Abhidharma writings and the teachings of the Vijñanavada school of Buddhist psychology give very thorough explanations of the essential nature of these five categories and the ways in which they function.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Heart of the Prajñaparamita Sutra tells us that the Bodhisattva Avalokita, thanks to his observation of the Five Aggregates, was able to see the interdependent nature of all dharmas and realize their essential birthlessness and deathlessness, and so transcend the fear of birth and death. The same sutra refers to the essential emptiness (Sanskrit: sunyata) of all dharmas. Emptiness, here, means interdependence. All dharmas depend on each other in order to arise and to endure. There is no dharma which can exist apart from other dharmas, and that is why we say that the real nature of dharmas is emptiness. Nothing can exist on its own.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Through discriminative investigation, we realize the interdependent nature of all that is. This is to realize the empty nature of all things. With insight into emptiness, we'll go beyond concepts of \"it is\" and \"it is not,\" birth and death, one and many, coming and going, and we'll transcend the fear of birth and death. Our concepts of it is/it is not, birth/death, one/many, coming/going, and so on, will dissolve when we're witness to the interdependent nature of all that is. To be able to end the concept of birth and death is the essential point of discriminative investigation.</p>\n",

      "<p>Some days before the layman Anathapindika passed away, the Buddha sent the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Ananda to visit him and instruct him in his practice. Sitting at the layman's bedside, the Venerable Sariputra began his instruction: \"Layman Anathapindika, you should meditate like this: 'These eyes are not me. I am not caught in these eyes.' \" Anathapindika breathed and meditated according to the instructions. Sariputra continued his instructions: \"These ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not me. I am not caught by forms, sounds, smells, tastes, contacts, or the thoughts that I have.\" Anathapindika observed in this way in order to see gradually the interdependent nature of all that is, to see that he himself was not restricted to the Eighteen Realms (the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses), and to see that there's no birth that brings us into existence and no death that takes us from existence to nonexistence.</p>\n",

      "<p>When he had practiced this much, Anathapindika began to weep, the tears falling down his cheeks. The Venerable Ananda asked, \"What is it? Do you regret anything? Did you not succeed in the meditation?\" Anathapindika replied, \"Venerable Ananda, I have nothing to regret, and my meditation has been very successful. I'm crying because I am so moved. I have been lucky enough to have served the Buddha and his community for many years, but I have never heard a teaching so deep, so wonderful, and so precious as the teaching transmitted by the Venerable Sariputra today.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>This excerpt about the layman Anathapindika (Majjhima Nikaya 143) shows us that anyone can practice the mindful observation of the interdependent and empty nature of things, not just monks or nuns.

      "<p>The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness also describes the mind that is not in a state of ignorance and confusion, as when we are conscious of impermanence, interdependence, and selflessness; when our mind rests in Right View. Right View is one of the eight ways of practice called the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the section that teaches how to be mindful of the objects of mind, among the Seven Factors of Awakening (Sanskrit: saptabodhyanga), the investigation of dharmas is mentioned. Investigation of dharmas means the detailed examination of the source and the nature of phenomena whether physical or psychological. Investigation of dharmas has a meaning similar to discriminative investigation and is also intended to see the source and the nature of dharmas. If we can understand in depth the source and the nature of dharmas, then our mind is not in a state of ignorance or confusion.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Each of the above fifteen exercises from the Satipatthana Sutta has, to a greater or lesser degree, the function of mindfully observing the source of dharmas. The most obvious examples are the eighth exercise—observation of the interdependence of the body and all that is in the universe: earth, water, air, and fire—and the twelfth exercise—the observation of the source and the nature of our feelings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When sitting in meditation, we concentrate our mind on the object of our observation—sometimes a physical phenomenon, sometimes psychological—and we look deeply into that object in order to discover its source and its nature. The role of our conscious breathing is to nourish and maintain our power of concentration on one object. If we look carefully and deeply, naturally we'll see that the arising, enduring, and ending of the object is dependent on other things. Eventually we'll see that the true nature of all dharmas is birthlessness and deathlessness, and that although dharmas are not everlasting, they're never totally destroyed. Thus the mindful observation of interdependence is the road that leads us to transcend the limits of birth and death. A student of Buddhism who doesn't practice the mindful observation of interdependence hasn't yet arrived at the quintessence of the Buddhist path.</p>\n",

      "<p>He is aware of the eyes [ears, nose, tongue, body, mind] and aware of the form [sound, smell, taste, touch, objects of mind], and he is aware of the internal formations which are produced in dependence on these two things. He is aware of the birth of a new internal formation and is aware of abandoning an already produced internal formation, and he is aware when an already abandoned internal formation will not arise again.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the section of the sutra that refers to the observation of the six sense organs and the six sense objects, we see the term \"internal formations.\" The word in Sanskrit is samyojana, which can also be translated as \"knots,\" \"fetters,\" \"agglomeration,\" or \"binding together.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Internal formations can be classified as two kinds, the Five Dull Knots: confusion, desire, anger, pride, and doubt; and the Five Sharp Knots: view of the body as self, extreme views, wrong views, perverted views, and superstitious views (or unnecessary ritual prohibitions). The latter are easier to correct. When the eyes see form, the ears hear sound, the nose smells a scent, the tongue tastes something, the body touches something, or the mind cognizes an object, knots may or may not be tied, depending on the way in which our mind receives these impressions. When someone speaks unkindly to us, if we understand the reason and we do not take the words to heart, we won't feel at all irritated, and a knot won't be formed in our mind. If we don't understand the reason and we feel irritated, a knot will form. The substance of this knot will be hatred. When we misunderstand someone's words or behavior, the knot that forms is confusion, which often gives rise to irritation, pride, attachment, and doubt. The knot of confusion, a lack of clear seeing, or ignorance (Sanskrit: avidya), is the basis for every other knot.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The feelings associated with internal formations are usually unpleasant, but sometimes internal formations are associated with pleasant feelings. When we are attached to a form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or mind object, an internal formation of the nature of desire is formed. To begin with, it can be associated with a pleasant feeling. But because we become attached to it, we are bound, and when the demands of the attachment are not met, the feelings become unpleasant. Anything from wine, tobacco, or opium to beautiful forms, good food, music, or words of praise can produce a knot in us, an internal formation that begins as a pleasant feeling. Once we have a such a knot, we are tied tightly by it, and we are forced to seek out the object of sense again and again in order to repeat the pleasant feeling.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Falling in love is also an internal formation, because in it there is the material of blind attachment. The term to \"fall\" in love in itself sounds disastrous. People often refer to love-sickness, as if falling in love were a disease. The French expression coup de foudre (struck by lightning) describes falling in love as a sharp blow. The author Nguyên Bính has said, \"Alas, only the gods can save someone who has fallen in love.\" But being in love can be transformed, so that blind attachment, selfishness, and domination are replaced by the capacity to understand and bring happiness to the person we love, without demanding specific conditions and expecting something in return. To transform being in love in this way is to transform an internal formation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Feelings of sorrow in us are also internal formations that arise from confusion, desire, hatred, pride, and doubt. If these roots of affliction are not transformed, the feelings of sorrow will remain intact in us. In everyday life, seeds of sorrow can be sown in our consciousness with or without the collaboration of others. Others may say or do things that produce knots in us, but if we give birth to the seeds of understanding, tolerance, love, and compassion, then what they say and do will not produce any internal formations in us. It depends on the way in which we receive what happens to us in our daily lives. If we are stable, relaxed, understanding, loving, compassionate, and not caught in egotism, then the things others do and say will not have the force to produce an internal formation in us.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If we live according to the teachings of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, we practice mindful observation of the arising, duration, and transformation of internal formations. In our daily life, we practice full awareness in order to be able to recognize the internal formation just born and find a way to transform it. If we allow internal formations to grow strong in us, the time will come when they will dominate us, and the work of transforming them will be extremely difficult. An internal formation of hatred, desire, or doubt needs our full attention as soon as it arises so that it may be transformed. When it arises for the first time, the knot is still very \"loose\" and the work of \"untying it\" is easy.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we live with another person, we should help each other transform the internal formations that we have produced in each other. By practicing understanding and loving speech, we can help each other a great deal. Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. Therefore, to transform the internal formations in the other is to bring about our own happiness as well. A person can create internal formations in her partner, and her partner can do so for her, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day they'll have no happiness left. A person needs to recognize quickly any newly formed knot inside herself. She should take the time to observe it and, with her partner's help, transform the internal formation. She might say, \"Darling, I have an internal formation. Can you please help me?\" This is easy when the states of mind of both partners are still light and not loaded with many internal formations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As we have already seen, the material of any internal formation is ignorance or confusion. If we can see the ignorance that is present during the creation of a knot, we can easily untie it. In the twelfth exercise (mindfully observing the source and nature of feelings), the fourteenth exercise (mindfully observing anger), and the fifteenth exercise (observing with compassion), we have seen that if we're aware of interdependence and multiple causation, we can see the roots and the nature of our mind and transform and transcend unpleasant states. Mindful observation is to look and be able to see the nature of dharmas. The transformation of an internal formation is the result of this insight.</p>\n",

He is aware of the birth of a new internal formation and is aware of abandoning an already produced internal formation, and he is aware when an already abandoned internal formation will not arise again. [This is the same quote as in Exercise 17.]</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This exercise aims at putting us in touch with and transforming internal formations that are buried and repressed in ourselves. The internal formations of desire, anger, fear, feeling worthless, and regret have been suppressed in our subconscious for a long time. Although they are suppressed, they are always seeking ways to manifest in our feelings, thoughts, words, and actions. It is easy for us to observe our internal formations when they appear as feelings on the surface of consciousness, but internal formations that are repressed cannot appear in a direct and natural way in the conscious mind. They only disclose themselves indirectly. Thus we're not aware of their presence, although they continue to tie us up and make us suffer in a latent way.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What is it that represses them and does not let them appear? It is our conscious, reasoning mind. We know that our desires and anger are not wholly acceptable to society and to our own reasoning mind, so we've found a way to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to be able to forget them. This is the work of a mental formation called mushita smrti, forgetfulness. Contemporary psychology understands repression. Because we want to avoid suffering, there are defense mechanisms in us that push our psychological pains, conflicts, and unacceptable desires into our unconscious so that we can feel more at peace with ourselves. But our longstanding repressions are always looking for ways to manifest in words, images, and behavior unacceptable to society and can later become symptoms of physical and psychological illness. We may know that our words, thoughts, and behavior are destructive, but we can't do anything about them because our internal formations are so strong.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Take for example a daughter who, on the one hand, wants to be with a partner or do her own things in the world, and on the other hand does not want to leave her mother to live all alone. The daughter understands and loves her mother, but she also wants to be independent and/or live with the person she loves. However, her mother is sick and needs someone to support her, and the daughter can't bear the thought of leaving her alone. The opposing desires and feelings bring about an internal conflict in the daughter. And so her defense mechanism represses the pain of the conflict in her unconscious and tells her to devote her life to supporting her mother. Nevertheless, the desire to be with her own partner is still there, and the psychological conflict remains an internal formation looking for a way to manifest. She becomes irritable and says things which even she herself does not understand, and she has dreams which are incomprehensible to her. She is not happy, and so her mother can't be happy either. In fact, her mother has been haunted for years by the fear that her daughter will leave her, and it is this psychological factor that made her unexpectedly fall sick and grow weak, although she's not aware of it. When she heard her daughter say that she was going to stay, she was very pleased, but in the depths of her heart, she suffers because she knows that her daughter is prevented from doing something she wants to do. This conflict becomes an internal formation in the mother, which makes her suffer, and the mother also becomes irritable and says things which she herself does not understand. She also has dreams she doesn't understand, and she does things without knowing why she's doing them. Neither the mother nor the daughter is happy, and both continue to suffer.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The method of curing the sorrow that comes when internal formations are repressed is the deep observation of these internal formations. But to observe them, first of all we have to find ways to bring them into the realm of the conscious mind. The method of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is to practice conscious breathing in order to recognize our feelings, thoughts, words, and actions, especially those which arise automatically, as reactions to what is happening. Our reactions may have their roots in the internal formations buried inside us.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we're aware of what we are feeling, thinking, and doing, we can ask ourselves questions like: Why do I feel uncomfortable when I hear someone say that? Why do I always think of my mother when I see that woman? Why did I say that to him? Why didn't I like that character in the film? Whom did I hate in the past who this person resembles? Practices like this can help us discover the roots of our feelings, thoughts, words, and behavior and gradually bring the internal formations buried in us into the realm of the conscious mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During our sitting meditation, because we have closed the doors of our sensory input in order to stop listening, looking, and reasoning, the internal formations that are buried in us have the opportunity to reveal themselves in the form of feelings or images that manifest in our conscious mind. To begin with, there may be just a feeling of anxiety, fear, or unpleasantness, whose cause we can't see. We have to shine the light of mindfulness on it and be ready to see this feeling.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When this feeling begins to show its face and to gather strength and become more intense, we may feel it robs us of all our peace, joy, and ease. We may not want to be in contact with it anymore. We may want to move our attention to another object of meditation. We may not want to continue with the meditation, and we may say that we're sleepy and would prefer to meditate some other time. In modern psychology, this is called resistance. Deep down we are afraid to bring into our conscious mind the feelings of pain that are buried within us, because they'll make us suffer.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are people who practice sitting meditation many hours a day, but they do not really dare to face and invite their feelings of pain into their conscious mind. They deceive themselves that these feelings aren't important and they give their attention to other subjects of meditation—impermanence, selflessness, the sound of one hand clapping, or the reason Bodhidharma came to the West. This isn't to suggest that these subjects are unimportant, but they should be considered in the light of our real problems in order to be authentic subjects for meditation practice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We don't practice mindfulness in Buddhism in order to repress our feelings, but as a way of looking after our feelings, being their sponsor in an affectionate, nonviolent way. When we're able to maintain mindfulness, we're not carried away by or drowned in our feelings or in the conflicts within ourselves. We nourish and maintain mindfulness through conscious breathing and try to become aware of our internal formations and conflicts as they manifest. We receive them with love as a mother takes her child in her arms: \"Mindfulness is present, and I know that I have enough strength to be in contact with the knots in me.\" In this kind of an environment, our internal formations will manifest as feelings and images in our mind that we can contact and identify fully and deeply.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Without judgment, blame, or criticism for having these feelings or images, we just observe, identify, and accept them in order to see their source and their true nature. If there's pain, we feel the pain. If there's sadness, we are sad. If there's anger, then we are angry, but our anger is accompanied by mindfulness. We don't lose ourselves in the pain, the sadness, or the anger, but we calm them down. Even if we haven't seen the roots of the internal formations, the fact that we can greet our pain, our sadness, and our anger in mindfulness already causes our internal knots to lose some of their strength. Thanks to our vigilant observation, eventually we'll see their roots and transform them. The teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness on how to be in direct contact with our feelings and invite them up to manifest on the surface of our consciousness is wonderfully effective. The practitioner can work with difficult internal formations with the help of a teacher or of a co-practitioner. The teacher and the co-practitioners, because of their mindful observation, can help point out to him the manifestations of the internal formations that lie deep in his consciousness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In his lifetime, the Buddha was praised as being a King of Doctors, and he helped thousands of people, including King Ajatasatru of Magadha, deal with mental problems. Those who practice mindful observation can learn the Buddhist way of dealing with internal formations in order to help themselves and others. Because many people live without practicing mindfulness and don't know how to transform internal formations, over time these internal formations become strong and lead to agitation, anxiety, and depression, which express themselves in speech and behavior that are not easily acceptable by society. Those with strong internal formations have difficulty relating to and working with others, and these difficulties make them feel more and more unsuccessful in society. As their internal formations increase, their behavior becomes more and more inappropriate, and eventually, the pressure may become so great that they'll have to quit their job or abandon their marriage.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If we know how to live every moment in an awakened way, we'll be aware of what's happening in our feelings and perceptions in the present moment and won't let internal formations become too tight in our consciousness. If we know how to observe our feelings, we can find the causes of longstanding internal formations and transform them.</p>\n",

      "<p>In Buddhist psychology, remorse or regret (Sanskrit: kaukrtya) is a mind function that can be either beneficial or damaging. When it's utilized to recognize errors we've made and to resolve not to commit the same mistakes in the future, then regret is a wholesome mental formation. If regret creates a guilt-complex that follows and haunts us, then it's an obstacle to our practice.</p>\n",

      "<p>We have all made mistakes in the past. But these mistakes can be erased. We may think that because the past is gone, we can't return to the past to correct our mistakes. But the past has created the present, and if we practice mindfulness in the present, we naturally are in contact with the past. As we transform the present, we also transform the past. Our ancestors, parents, brothers, and sisters are all closely linked to us—our suffering and happiness is closely linked to theirs, just as their suffering and happiness is closely linked to ours. If we can transform ourselves, we also transform them. Our own emancipation, peace, and joy is the emancipation, peace, and joy of our ancestors and our parents. To take hold of the present in order to transform it is the unique way to bring peace, joy, and emancipation to those we love and to heal the damage done in the past.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Confession in Buddhism is based on the fact that we commit errors by means of our mind, and so by means of our mind those errors can be erased. If we take hold of life in the present moment in order to transform ourselves, we can create joy for ourselves and for everyone else as well. This transformation will bring about real joy and peace in the present and also in the future. It's not just a hollow promise to do better. If we can take hold of our breathing and live in a mindful way, thus bringing joy and happiness to ourselves and others in the present moment, we can overcome our complexes of guilt so that we're no longer paralyzed by them.</p>\n",

But if that person practices mindfulness and is able to be in real contact with the present moment, knowing what to do and what not to do in the present moment, she can save the lives of many children. Many small children die for want of medicine. Many children die through accidents or for want of proper care and attention. So she can work to save the children who are dying instead of imprisoning herself and dying slowly in the chains of regret.</p>\n",

      "<p>Fear is also a dominant internal formation in many of us. The ground of fear is ignorance, the failure to understand our \"not-self\" nature. Insecurity and fear of what might happen to us and those dear to us are feelings we all have, but for some, these insecurities and fears dominate their consciousness. In Mahayana Buddhism, the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara is described as the one who has transcended all fear. He offers all beings the gift of non-fear (Sanskrit: abhaya), which comes from the mindful observation of the no-birth, no-death, no-increase, and no-decrease nature of all that is. The Prajñaparamita Heart Sutra is an exhortation on fearlessness. If we can observe deeply the interdependent and selfless nature of all things, we can see that there is no birth and no death and pass beyond all fear.<footnote-ref id=\"4\">4</footnote-ref></p>\n",

If we live every moment of our lives mindfully and relate beautifully with those around us, we'll have nothing to fear and nothing to regret, even when there is a crisis in our lives. If we know that birth and death are both necessary aspects of life, we'll see that if our mother the Earth has brought us to life once, she will bring us to life one hundred thousand times more, and we will not be afraid or suffer when she reaches out her arms to welcome us back. An Awakened One remains unperturbed while riding the waves of birth and death.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The purpose of this exercise is to sow and water the seeds of peace, joy, and liberation in us. If internal formations are the seeds of suffering, then joy, peace, and liberation are the seeds of happiness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Buddhist psychology talks of seeds as the basis of every state of mind and the content of our consciousness. Certain seeds were transmitted to us by our parents and our ancestors. These are seeds of Buddha, Bodhisattva, Pratyekabuddha (one who has reached liberation by one's own efforts but just for one's own sake), Sravaka (one who practices as a disciple by listening to the teachings), God, Human, Warrior-God, Animal, Hungry Ghost, and Hell-Being. This means that before we were born, there were already many kinds of wholesome and unwholesome seeds in us. In addition, there are many kinds of seeds that form in us from an early age, planted by our family, school, and society. Seeds that produce suffering we can call \"unwholesome,\" and seeds that produce happiness we can call \"wholesome.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>According to the principle of interdependent origination, seeds do not have a fixed nature. Every seed is dependent on every other seed for its existence, and in any one seed, all the other seeds are present. Any unwholesome seed contains within it the germ of wholesome seeds, and a wholesome seed contains within it the germ of unwholesome seeds. Just as there has to be night for there to be day and death for there to be birth, an unwholesome seed can be transformed into a wholesome seed, and a wholesome seed can be transformed into an unwholesome seed. This fact tells us that in the darkest times of our lives, in the times of the greatest suffering, the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness are still present in us. If we know how to contact the seeds of joy, peace, and happiness that are already present in us, and if we know how to water and look after them, they will germinate and bring us the fruits of peace, joy, and liberation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The sutra is always reminding us of the two contrasting aspects of the mind. The state of mind that has no desire is a wholesome state of mind called \"desirelessness.\" The state of mind that has no anger is a wholesome state of mind called \"no-anger.\" Desirelessness, no-anger, and freedom are wholesome seeds in the mind that need to be watered and cared for.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The sutras often refer to the mind as a plot of ground in which all sorts of seeds are sown. That is why we have the Sanskrit term cittabhumi, \"the mind as the earth.\" When we practice mindfulness, we should not just observe the phenomena of birth, old age, sickness, death, desire, hatred, aversion, ignorance, doubt, and wrong views. We should also take the time to observe objects of the mind that lead to health, joy, and emancipation in order to enable wholesome seeds to germinate and flower in the field of the mind. Observing Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, love, compassion, joy, letting go, mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, ease, happiness, and equanimity, is always encouraged in Buddhism. Joy (Sanskrit: mudita), for example, is not just the joy that arises from the joy of others, but also the feeling of well-being that arises in ourselves. Mudita is one of the Four Unlimited Minds; love, compassion, and letting go or equanimity are the other three. The seeds of mudita are in all of us. Only when we have joy in our lives can we be happy and have the means to share our happiness with others. If we do not have joy, what can we share with others? If the seeds of our joy are buried under many layers of suffering, how can we smile and share joy with others? This exercise helps us stay in touch with the wholesome seeds in us so that they have a chance to develop.</p>\n",

There is spring as well as winter, light as well as darkness, health as well as sickness, gentle breezes and delightful rains as well as tempests and floods.

We only need to open our eyes and we can see the blue sky, the white clouds, the rose, the clear river, the golden fields of wheat, the shining eyes of a child. We only have to attune our ears to hear the whispering pines and the waves washing up on the shore. Everything is impermanent. Everything is in a temporary form. Nevertheless, there are many wonderful things. In us and around us, there are so many wondrous phenomena in nature that can refresh and heal us. If we can be in contact with them, we will receive their healing benefits. If peace and joy are in our hearts, we will gradually bring more peace and joy to the world.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The blue sky, the white clouds, the gentle breezes, the delightful rains, political stability, free speech, good schools for children, beautiful flowers, and good health—these are the positive ingredients of peace and happiness that exist alongside the negative ingredients such as war, sexism, social injustice, racial discrimination, economic inequality, and hunger and starvation. It is important that we be aware of these ugly, dangerous things in the world, so that we can begin to improve the situation. But if, day after day, we are only in contact with our anxieties and our anger about what is ugly and corrupt, we will lose our joy and our ability to serve others. That is why we have to be in contact with the peaceful and positive aspects in and around us and be able to enjoy them. We need to teach our children how to appreciate these wondrous and precious things. If we know how to appreciate them, we will know how to protect them. This basic practice will protect our happiness and our children's happiness as well.</p>\n",

      "<p>There are many people who, although they know in theory that a flower is a wonderful thing, are unable to be in contact with it, because the sorrow in their hearts has closed them off. In the past, they may not have allowed themselves to be in contact with the refreshing, healthy seeds in their consciousness, and as a result, they are now cut off from them. The seventh precept of the Order of Interbeing reminds us to practice conscious breathing in order to stay in contact with the many healing and refreshing elements which are already around us. At times we may need the support of a friend to help us get back in touch with what is wonderful in life. \"A meal needs soup as the practice needs friends\" is a Vietnamese proverb about the importance of practicing with friends. Such a community of friends and fellow practitioners is called a Sangha. On the path of practice we need the support of this community, and so we say, \"I take refuge in the Sangha.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Having one calm, joyful friend who is balanced and can understand and support us in times of difficulty is a great fortune. When we feel helpless, depressed, and discouraged, we can go to that friend, and, sitting with him, we can reestablish our equilibrium and once again be able to contact the flower and the other wonderful, refreshing things that exist within us and around us. If we receive the benefits of the joy that our friend brings us, we can refresh the seeds of healing in us that have become weak because they have not been cared for or watered for a long time.</p>\n",

      "<p>The seeds of understanding, love, peace, joy, and liberation need to be sown and watered constantly by living our daily lives in mindfulness. The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness offers many exercises for living in mindfulness. By the process of conscious breathing, smiling, walking meditation, sitting meditation, by our way of looking, listening and mindfully observing, we help the seeds of happiness flourish. The realms of love, compassion, joy, and letting go are the realms of true joy and happiness. If we have joy and can let go, we can share happiness with others and reduce their sorrows and anxieties.</p>\n",

      "<p>All dharmas—physical, physiological, and psychological—are objects of mind, but that does not mean that they exist separately from the mind. All Four Establishments of Mindfulness—body, feelings, mind, and dharmas—are objects of mind. Since mind and objects of mind are one, in observing its objects, mind is essentially observing mind. The word dharma in Buddhism is understood to mean the object of the mind and the content of the mind. Dharmas are classified as one of the Twelve Realms (Sanskrit: ayatana). The first six of these realms are the sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The remaining six are form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharmas. Dharmas are the object of the mind, as sounds are the object of the ears. The object of cognition and the subject of cognition do not exist independently of each other. Everything that exists has to arise in the mind. The culminating phase of the development of this principle is expressed in the phrase, \"All is just mind. All phenomena are just consciousness,\" which means, \"Because of mind, all can exist. Because of consciousness, all phenomena can exist.\" This is developed in the Vijñaptimatra school of Mahayana Buddhism.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the Southern traditions of Buddhism, the idea of mind as the source of all dharmas is also very clear. The term cittasamutthana (mind-arising) and the term cittaja (mind-born) are often used in the Pali Abhidhamma writings. In the Patthana (equivalent to the Sanskrit Mahapakarana), the phrase cittam samutthanam ca rupanam (\"and mind is the arising point of forms\") is found.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The object of our mindful observation can be our breath or our toe (physiological), a feeling or a perception (psychological), or a form (physical). Whether the phenomenon we observe is physiological, psychological, or physical, we know that it is not separate from our mind and is of one substance with our mind. Mind can be understood as individual mind and as collective mind. The Vijñanavada teachings make this very clear. We need to avoid thinking that the object we are observing is independent of our mind. We have to remember that it is manifested from our individual and collective consciousnesses. We observe the object of our mind in the way the right hand takes hold of the left hand. Your right hand is you and your left hand is also you. So the hand is taking hold of itself to become one with itself.</p>\n",

      "<section level=\"2\"><principle>BE ONE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBSERVATION</principle></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The subject of observation is our mindfulness, which also emanates from the mind. Mindfulness has the function of illuminating and transforming. When our breathing, for example, is the object of our mindfulness, it becomes conscious breathing. Mindfulness shines its light on our breathing, transforms the forgetfulness in it into mindfulness, and gives it a calming and healing quality. Our body and our feelings are also illuminated and transformed under the light of mindfulness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mindfulness is the observing mind, but it does not stand outside of the object of observation. It goes right into the object and becomes one with it. Because the nature of the observing mind is mindfulness, the observing mind does not lose itself in the object but transforms it by illuminating it, just as the penetrating light of the sun transforms trees and plants.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If we want to see and understand, we have to penetrate and become one with the object. If we stand outside of it in order to observe it, we cannot really see and understand it. The work of observation is the work of penetrating and transforming. That is why the sutra says, \"observing the body in the body, observing the feelings in the feelings, observing the mind in the mind, observing dharmas in dharmas.\" The description is very clear. The deeply observing mind is not merely an observer but a participant. Only when the observer is a participant can there be transformation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the practice called bare observation, mindfulness has already begun to influence the object of consciousness. When we call an in-breath an in-breath, the existence of our breath becomes very clear. Mindfulness has already penetrated our breathing. If we continue in our mindful observation, there will no longer be a duality between observer and observed. Mindfulness and breath are one. We and our breath are one. If our breath is calm, we are calm. Our breathing calms our body and our feelings. This is the method taught in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If our mind is consumed by a sense desire or by what we are observing, mindfulness is not present. Conscious breathing nourishes mindfulness, and mindfulness gives rise to conscious breathing. When mindfulness is present, we have nothing to fear. The object of our observation becomes vivid, and its source, origin, and true nature become evident. That is how it will be transformed. It no longer has the effect of binding us.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When the object of our mindful observation is totally clear, the mind that is observing is also fully revealed in great clarity.To see dharmas clearly is to see the mind clearly. When dharmas reveal themselves in their true nature, then the mind has the nature of the highest understanding. The subject and the object of cognition are not separate.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<section level=\"2\"><principle>TRUE MIND AND DELUDED MIND ARE ONE</principle></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"True mind\" and \"deluded mind\" are two aspects of the mind. Both arise from the mind. Deluded mind is the forgetful and dispersed mind, which arises from forgetfulness. The basis of true mind is awakened understanding, arising from mindfulness. Mindful observation brings out the light which exists in true mind, so that life can be revealed in its reality. In that light, confusion becomes understanding, wrong views become right views, mirages become reality, and deluded mind becomes true mind. Once mindful observation is born, it will penetrate the object of observation, illuminate it, and gradually reveal its true nature. The true mind arises from deluded mind. Things in their true nature and illusions are of the same basic substance. That is why practice is a matter of transforming deluded mind and not a matter of seeking for a true mind elsewhere. Just as the surface of a rough sea and that of the sea when it is calm are both manifestations of the same sea, true mind could not exist if there were no deluded mind. In the teaching on the Three Doors to Liberation (Pali: vimokkha-mukha), aimlessness (Sanskrit: apranihita) is the foundation for realization. What is meant by aimlessness is that we do not seek after an object outside of ourselves. In Mahayana Buddhism, the teaching of nonattainment is the highest expression of the oneness of true mind and deluded mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If the rose is on its way to becoming garbage, then the garbage is also on its way to becoming a rose. She who observes discerningly will see the nondual character of the rose and the garbage. She will be able to see that there is garbage in the rose and that there are roses in the garbage. She will know that the rose needs the garbage for its existence, and the garbage needs the rose, because it is the rose that becomes garbage. Therefore, she will know how to accept the garbage in order to transform it into roses and will not be afraid when she sees the rose wither and turn into garbage. This is the principle of nonduality. If true mind (the rose) can be discovered in the raw material of deluded mind (the garbage), then we can also recognize true mind in the very substance of illusion, in the substance of birth and death.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To be liberated is not to run away from or abandon the Five Skandhas of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Even if our body is full of impurities and even if the world is of the nature of illusion, it does not mean that to be liberated we need to run away from our body or from the world. The world of liberation and awakened understanding comes directly from this body and this world. Once Right Understanding is realized, we transcend the discriminations between pure and impure and illusory and real objects of perception. If the gardener is able to see that the rose comes directly from the garbage, then the practitioner on the path of meditation can see that nirvana comes directly from birth and death, and she no longer runs away from birth and death or seeks after nirvana. \"The roots of affliction (Sanskrit: klesa) are the same as the awakened state. Nirvana and birth and death are illusory images in space.\" These quotations express deep insight into nonduality. The substance of this insight is equanimity or letting go (Sanskrit: upeksa), one of the Four Unlimited Minds.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Buddha taught very clearly that we should not be attached to being or nonbeing. Being means the desire realm. Nonbeing means the realm of nihilism. To be liberated is to be free from both.</p>\n",

      "<section level=\"2\"><principle>THE WAY OF NO-CONFLICT</principle></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The realization of nonduality naturally leads to the practice of offering joy, peace, and nonviolence. If the gardener knows how to deal with the organic garbage without conflict and discrimination, then the practitioner of meditation should also know how to deal with the Five Aggregates without conflict or discrimination. The Five Aggregates are the basis of suffering and confusion, but they are also the basis of peace, joy, and liberation. We should not have an attitude of attachment or aversion to the Five Aggregates. It is clearly stated in the sutra that the practitioner observes, having put aside every craving and every distaste for this life (Pali: vineyya loke abhijjha domanassam).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Before realizing the awakened state, Siddhartha practiced austerities, repressing his body and his feelings. Methods such as these are violent in nature, and the results are only negative. After that period of practice, he changed and practiced nonviolence and no-conflict in relation to his body and his feelings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The method taught by the Buddha in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness clearly expresses the spirit of nonviolence and no-conflict. Mindfulness recognizes what is happening in the body and the mind and then continues to illuminate and observe the object deeply. During this practice, there is no craving for, running after, or repressing the object. This is the true meaning of the term bare observation. There is no coveting and no distaste. We know that our body and our feelings are ourselves and therefore we do not repress them, because to do so would be to repress ourselves. On the contrary, we accept our body and our feelings. Accepting does not mean craving. By accepting, we naturally reach a degree of peace and understanding. Peace and joy arise when we drop the discrimination between right and wrong; between the mind that observes and the body that is being observed (which we say is impure); between the mind that observes and the feelings that are being observed (which we say are painful).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we accept our body and our feelings, we treat them in an affectionate, nonviolent way. The Buddha taught us to practice mindfulness of physiological and psychological phenomena in order to observe them, not in order to suppress them. When we accept our body, make peace with it, and calm its functioning, not feeling aversion to it, we are following the teachings of the Buddha: \"Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body. Breathing out, I am calming the functions of my body.\" (Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing). In observation meditation, we do not turn ourselves into a battlefield with the good side fighting the bad. When we can see the nonduality of the rose and the garbage, the roots of affliction and the awakened mind, we are no longer afraid. We accept our afflictions, look after them as a mother looks after her child, and transform them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we recognize the roots of affliction in us and become one with them, whether we are entrapped in them or not depends on our state of mind. When we are forgetful, we may be caught by our roots of affliction, and so we become our roots of affliction. When we are mindful, we can see our roots of affliction clearly and transform them. Therefore, it is essential to see our roots of affliction in mindfulness. As long as the lamp of mindfulness shines its light, the darkness is transformed. We need to nourish mindfulness in ourselves by the practices of conscious breathing, hearing the sound of a bell, reciting gathas, and many other skillful means.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We need an attitude of kindness and nonviolence toward our body. We should not look on our body as only an instrument or mistreat it. When we are tired or in pain, our body is trying to tell us that it is not happy and at ease. The body has its own language. As practitioners of mindfulness, we should know what our body is saying to us. When we feel a lot of pain in our legs during sitting meditation, we should smile and change our position slowly and gently in mindfulness. There is nothing wrong with changing our position. It does not waste our time. As long as mindfulness is maintained, the work of meditation continues. We should not bully ourselves. When we push ourselves around like that, not only do we lose our peace of mind and our joy, but we also lose our mindfulness and concentration. We practice sitting meditation to have liberation, peace, and joy, not to become a hero who is capable of enduring a lot of pain.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We also need a nonviolent attitude with regard to our feelings. Because we know that our feelings are ourselves, we do not neglect or overrule them. We embrace them affectionately in the arms of mindfulness, as a mother embraces her newborn child when it cries. A mother embraces the child with all her love for the child to feel comforted and stop crying. Mindfulness nourished by conscious breathing takes the feelings in its arms, becomes one with them, calms and transforms them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Before the Buddha attained full realization of the path, he tried various methods of using the mind to suppress the mind, and he failed. That is why he chose to practice in a nonviolent way. The Buddha recounted in the Mahasaccaka Sutra (Madhyama Agama 36):</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I thought, why do I not grit my teeth, press my tongue against my palate, use my mind to overrule my mind, use my mind to repress my mind? Then, as a wrestler might take hold of the head or the shoulders of someone weaker than him, and, in order to restrain and coerce that person, he has to hold him down constantly without letting go for a moment, so I gritted my teeth, pressed my tongue against my palate, and used my mind to overrule and suppress my mind. As I did this, I was bathed in sweat. Although I was not lacking in strength, although I maintained mindfulness and did not fall from mindfulness, my body and my mind were not at peace, and I was worn out by these exhausting efforts. This practice caused other feelings of pain to arise in me besides the pain associated with the austerities, and I was not able to tame my mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It is clear from this passage that the Buddha regarded this kind of practice as not useful. Yet, this passage was inserted into the Vitakkasanthana Sutra (Majjhima Nikaya 20), with the opposite meaning to what the Buddha intended:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Just as a wrestler takes hold of the head or the shoulders of someone weaker than himself, restrains and coerces that person, and holds him down constantly, not letting go one moment, so a monk who meditates in order to stop all unwholesome thoughts of desire and aversion, when these thoughts continue to arise, should grit his teeth, press his tongue against his palate, and do his best to use his mind to beat down and defeat his mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This same passage was inserted into the Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness which appears as the second version in this book (see Appendix): \"The practitioner who observes body as body closes his lips tightly or grits his teeth, presses his tongue against his palate, and uses his mind to restrain and to oppose his mind.\" This extract does not appear in most versions of the sutra (see the first and third versions), but is also found in the Kayasmrti Sutra (Madhyama Agama 81) whose content is very similar to that of our second version. The corresponding sutra in Pali is the Kayagatasati Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 119).</p>\n",

      "<section level=\"2\"><principle>OBSERVATION IS NOT INDOCTRINATION</principle></section>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In Buddhist practice centers throughout the world, students are taught to recite such phrases as \"body is impure, feelings are suffering, mind is impermanent, dharmas are without self,\" as they observe the Four Establishments. I was taught in this way as a novice, and I always felt that it was a kind of brainwashing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The method of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is observing deeply in the spirit of \"not craving and not feeling distaste.\" Mindfulness does not cling, push away, reprimand, or repress, so that the true nature of all dharmas can reveal itself in the light of mindful observation. That the impermanent, selfless, and impure nature of all dharmas has the effect of causing suffering can be seen while we observe dharmas, but that is not because we repeat some formulas like the above, in an automatic way. When we look deeply and see the true nature of all dharmas, they will reveal themselves.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we mechanically repeat, \"Body is impure,\" we are reciting a dogma. If we observe all physiological phenomena and see their impure nature, this is not dogma. It is our experience. If, during our mindful observation, we see that phenomena are sometimes pure and sometimes impure, then that is our experience. If we look even more deeply and see that phenomena are neither pure nor impure, that they transcend the concepts of pure and impure, we discover what is taught in the Heart of the Prajñaparamita Sutra. This sutra also teaches us to resist all dogmatic attitudes. We should not force ourselves to see the body as impure or the feelings as suffering. Although there may be some truth in the sentences, just repeating them dogmatically has the effect of cramming us with knowledge. While we observe in mindfulness, we may see that we have many painful feelings, but we will also see that we have many joyful and peaceful feelings and many neutral feelings. And if we look more deeply, we will see that neutral feelings can become joyful feelings, and that suffering and happiness are interdependent. Suffering is, because happiness is; and happiness is, because suffering is. When we repeat, \"Mind is impermanent,\" our attitude is still dogmatic. If the mind is impermanent, then the body must be impermanent and the feelings too. The same is true of \"Dharmas are selfless.\" If dharmas are selfless, so are body, mind, and feelings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Therefore, the special teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is to observe all dharmas but not to have any fixed ideas, just to keep on observing mindfully without comment, without assuming any attitude towards the object you are observing. In this way, the true nature of the object will be able to reveal itself in the light of mindful observation, and you will have insight into wonderful discoveries such as no-birth no-death, neither pure nor impure, neither increasing nor decreasing, interpenetration, and interbeing.</p>\n",

      "<p>The last part of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness reads: \"He who practices the Four Establishments of Mindfulness for seven years can expect one of two fruits: the highest understanding in this very life or, if there remains some residue of affliction, he can attain the fruit of no-return. Let alone seven years, bhikkhus, whoever practices the Four Establishments of Mindfulness for six, five, four, three, two years, or one year, or even six, five, four, three, two months, one month or half a month can also expect one of two fruits: either the highest understanding or the fruit of no-return. It may take seven years to attain the fruits of the practice, but people who have great willingness to practice don't need seven years; it is enough to have half a month. That is why we say that this path of the Establishments of Mindfulness is the most wonderful path, which helps beings realize purification, transcend grief and sorrow, and destroy pain and anxiety. The bhikkhus were delighted to hear the teaching of the Buddha. They took it to heart and began to put it into practice.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Mindfulness is the core of Buddhist practice. This practice can be done not only in sitting meditation but also in every minute of our daily life. When we are able to take hold of our body in mindfulness, we begin to master our mind, and our body and mind become one. If our practice of mindfulness is still weak, our body is like a wild buffalo. Mindfulness is the herdsman and our mind is the wild buffalo.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Ten Oxherding Paintings of the Zen tradition represent stages on the path of awakening, stages on the path of mastering the body and mind. In the beginning the trainer approaches the wild buffalo; trainer and buffalo are two separate entities. With the practice of mindfulness, the trainer comes to know the buffalo. Gradually, the trainer and the buffalo become one, and eventually the trainer is able to ride on the back of the buffalo, singing or playing the flute, and the buffalo can go wherever he likes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When we stand, walk, sit, lie down, or work in mindfulness, we are practicing what the Buddha taught us in the sutra. But in order for the practice to be easy and successful, it is very helpful to practice with a community, called a Sangha. The presence of those who practice mindful living is a great support and encouragement to us. Seeing people walking, sitting, being, and doing things in mindfulness, we are reminded to maintain mindfulness ourselves. In Buddhist communities, people use bells of mindfulness to remind one another to practice. The bell sounds from time to time and calls us back to being mindful. The presence of the people who practice around us is equivalent to the presence of several bells of mindfulness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With a Sangha, we get support whenever we need it, and we profit from the experience and insight of its members and also from their advice and guidance. A teacher is a treasure, but without a Sangha, the practice can still be difficult.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Therefore getting in touch with an existing Sangha or setting up a small Sangha around us is a very important step. We should be able to participate from time to time in a retreat of five days or a week to practice mindfulness in a concentrated atmosphere. With friends we can organize from time to time a Day of Mindfulness to practice together. A Day of Mindfulness can also be organized in the family for all the adults and children to practice together. It is good if we can invite a number of friends to join us.</p>\n",

      "<p>Practicing Buddhist meditation is not a way of avoiding society or family life. The correct practice of mindfulness can help us bring peace, joy, and release both to ourselves and to our family and friends as well. Those who practice mindful living will inevitably transform themselves and their way of life. They will live a more simple life and will have more time to enjoy themselves, their friends, and their natural environment. They will have more time to offer joy to others and to alleviate their suffering. And when the time comes, they will die in peace. They will know that to die is to begin anew or just to continue with another form of life. When we live our life this way, every day is a Happy Birthday, a Happy Continuation Day.</p>\n",

But his teachings spread far beyond the area where that language was spoken, and there is no doubt that in the practice centers that lay beyond the alluvial plain of the Ganges River, the monks and nuns would have studied the Dharma in their own local languages. One day in the Jetavana monastery, two monks, Yamelu and Tekula, asked the Buddha if they could translate all his teachings into the classical meter of the Vedic language. They told the Buddha that they wanted to do so in order to protect the beauty and accuracy of the Dharma. But the Buddha did not want his teachings to become a precious object reserved for a scholarly elite. He wanted everyone to be able to study and practice the Dharma in her own language.</p>\n",

      "<p>About four months after the passing of the Buddha, the Venerable Mahakasyapa convened a council on Mount Saptaparnaguha at Rajgir in order to orally collate the Sutra and Vinaya Pitakas. Five hundred elder bhikkhus were invited to attend this Collation Council, which was sponsored by King Ajatasatru of Magadha. The language of the collation would naturally have been Ardhamagadhi, the language of the Buddha. If the local districts later developed versions in their own languages, these would have been based on the collation of the Rajgir Council.</p>\n",

      "<p>One hundred years later, a second council was convened in Vaisali to further collate the canon of the Buddha's teachings. On this occasion, seven hundred bhikkhus were invited to attend. After the Second Council, in 375 BCE, the community of bhikkhus divided itself into two schools: the Sthavira, which tended to be conservative, and the Mahasanghika, which tended to promote development and reform. The followers of the Mahasanghika were more numerous. In the three hundred years that followed, many other schools branched off from these two schools. According to the Samayabhedoparacanacakra by Vasumitra, who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of the Northern tradition, there were eighteen schools in all.</p>\n",

All three pitakas of the Theravada school are intact thanks to the relatively stable ground for practice in Sri Lanka. The Tripitaka of this school is written in the Pali language, which originated in western India. The Theravada arose from the Vibhajyavada, which was a school opposing the Sarvastivada.</p>\n",

      "<p>The second and third versions are from the Chinese Canon. The second version, the Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness, is a translation of the Nian Chu Jing (number 98 in the Madhyama Agama and number 26 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka) of the Sarvastivada school, translated into Chinese from the Sanskrit Smrtyupasthana Sutra. The third version, The One Way In Sutra, is a translation of the Yi Ru Dao Jing (Ekottara Agama, sutra number 125 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka). It comes from the Mahasanghika school, not in its original but in its later form.</p>\n",

      "<p>In the Chinese Canon, the name of the translator of the Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness is given as Gautama Sanghadeva. Master Sanghadeva came from what is now Afghanistan and traveled to China in the fourth century, living from the year 383 in the capital Chang An, and after that in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin. He began the work of translation between 391 and 398. He probably had learned Chinese when he lived in Chang An.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Chinese Canon also ascribes the translation of The One Way In Sutra to Gautama Sanghadeva. However, there are many reasons for thinking that the sutra was translated by the monk Dharmanandi. Master Dharmanandi was Khotanese. He traveled to China in the fourth century and took up residence in Chang An, where he translated sutras from 384-391. The book Marking the Era of Buddhism (K'ai Yuan Shi Pi Chiao Lu) says that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Sanghadeva. Master Tao An, in his introduction to The One Way In Sutra, says that it was Master Dharmanandi who read the original Sanskrit version for Zhu Fo Nian to translate into Chinese and for Gautama Sanghadeva to write down. After that, they brought the translated version to be examined by the translation school of Master Sanghadeva in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin.</p>\n",

      "<p>The Li Tai San Pao Chi, Volume 7 (Sui Dynasty), the Ta T'ang Nei Tien Lu, and the Ta T'ang Ch'an Ting Chung Ching Mu Lu, all say that there were two translations of the Ekottara Agama, one by Master Dharmanandi and one by Master Sanghadeva. The books Ch'u San Tsang Chi Chi and the Chung Ching Mu Lu of the Sui Dynasty, and the Sutra Index of the T'ang Dynasty, all say that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Master Dharmanandi. Judging from all of this information and from the literary style of the text, we conclude that there was only one translation of the Ekottara Agama, the translation of Master Dharmanandi.</p>\n",

      "<p>The Mahasanghika school, which came into existence after the council at Vaisali, later divided into two branches, one going to the northwest and one to the south. There were five branches of Mahasanghika in the northwest, including the Lokottaravada, which was Mahayana in outlook. It was the Ekottara Agama of this branch, including the third version of the sutra on mindfulness presented in this book, that Dharmanandi translated. Therefore, our third version is more influenced by the Mahayana and can be said to be less close to the original teaching of the Buddha than the first two versions, because many later elements have infiltrated into it. Still, it contains the essence of the original teachings.</p>\n",

When he wakes up, he knows he is waking up. Awake or asleep, he knows he is awake or asleep. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, when practicing awareness of the body, the practitioner is clearly aware of the positions and movements of the body, such as going out and coming in, bending down and standing up, extending limbs, or drawing them in. When wearing the sanghati robe, carrying the alms bowl, walking, standing, lying, sitting, speaking, or being silent, he knows the skillful way of being aware. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, from both within and from without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body as body so that whenever an unwholesome state of mind arises, he can immediately apply a wholesome state to counterbalance and transform the unwholesome state of mind. Just as a carpenter or carpenter's apprentice stretches out a piece of string along the edge of a plank of wood and with a plane trims off the edge of the plank, so the practitioner, when he feels an unwholesome state of mind arising, immediately uses a wholesome state of mind to counterbalance and transform the existing state. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, from both within and from without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body as body when, closing his lips tight, clenching his teeth, pressing his tongue against his palate, taking one part of his mind to restrain another part of his mind, he counterbalances a thought and transforms it. Just as two strong men might hold onto a weak man and easily restrain him, so the practitioner presses his lips together and clenches his teeth, presses his tongue against his palate, takes one part of his mind to restrain another part of his mind, to counterbalance and transform a thought. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, from both within and from without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body as body, when, breathing in, he knows that he is breathing in, and breathing out, he knows that he is breathing out. When breathing in a long breath, he knows that he is breathing in a long breath. When breathing out a long breath, he knows that he is breathing out a long breath. When breathing in, he is aware of his whole body. Breathing out, he is aware of his whole body. Breathing in and out, he is aware of what he is doing and he practices stopping while acting. Breathing in and out, he is aware of what he is saying and he practices stopping while speaking.

This feeling of bliss which arises during concentration reaches every part of his body.

Like a spring within a mountain whose clear water flows out and down all sides of that mountain and bubbles up in places where water has not previously entered, saturating the entire mountain, in the same way, joy, born during concentration, permeates the whole of the practitioner's body; it is present everywhere. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, from both within and from without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",

He practices \"the one way in\" by means of clear light, and finally his mind is not obscured in darkness.

This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, from both within and from without, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of the body, knows very well that this body exists due to the interdependence of the parts of the body, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet.

He sees all these clearly as someone with good eyesight sees in a cask full of all sorts of grains that this is rice, this is millet, this is mustard seed, and so on. The practitioner who takes his attention throughout his body knows that it only exists in dependence on the true value of the parts out of which it is made, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet, and sees that all those parts are impure.

      "<p>\"In this case, the practitioner meditates on the nature and functions of the body. When he examines it from head to toes or from toes to head, he sees that it is composed of impure constituents, and he is unable to be attached to it. He observes that this body has hair of the head and hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, sweat, pus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys. He observes and recognizes urine, excrement, tears, saliva, blood vessels, grease, and observing and knowing them all, he is unattached and regrets nothing. This is the way the practitioner observes the body in order to realize peace and joy and be able to end unwholesome thoughts and remove anxiety and sorrow.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further the practitioner meditates on this body in order to see the Four Elements of earth, water, fire, and air, and he distinguishes these Four Elements. Just like a skillful butcher or his apprentice might lay out the different parts of a slaughtered cow and distinguish the leg, heart, torso, and head, the practitioner observing his own body distinguishes the Four Elements just as clearly, seeing that this is earth, this is water, this is fire, and this is air. Thus the practitioner meditates on the body in the body in order to end attachment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, one should observe this body as having many openings from which many impure substances flow. Just as we look at bamboo or reeds and see the joints in the canes, so the practitioner observes the body with many openings from which impure substances flow.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner meditates on the corpse of one who has died one day ago or one week ago. It is distended, fetid, impure. Then he meditates on his own body and sees that his own body is no different. This very body of his will not be able to escape death. The practitioner observes this corpse being seen and pecked at by vultures, being discovered and gnawed at by all sorts of wild creatures like tigers, panthers, and wolves, and then comes back to observing his own body and sees that it is no different. 'This very body of mine will not be able to escape that condition.' This is how the practitioner meditates on the body to realize peace and joy.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse, which has lain on the ground for a year. It is half-eaten, fetid, and impure.

This is how the practitioner meditates on the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes the corpse from which the skin and flesh has shriveled away. All that is left are the bones stained with blood.

      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, the practitioner visualizes a corpse which has become a collection of yellowing bones, to which there is nothing worth being attached, or bones that have become the color of ash and are no longer distinguishable from the earth. Thus the practitioner meditates on his own body, abandoning unwholesome thoughts and removing sorrow and anxiety, observing, 'This body is impermanent, it is something which decomposes.' A practitioner who observes himself like this from within or from without, or both from within and without the body together understands that there is nothing which is eternal.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>\"When the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, he knows that he has a pleasant feeling. When he has a painful feeling, he knows that he has a painful feeling. When his feelings are neutral, he knows that his feelings are neutral. When he has a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling with a material basis, he knows that he has a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling with a material basis. When he has a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling with a nonmaterial basis, he knows he has a pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling with a nonmaterial basis. This is how the practitioner meditates on the feelings in the feelings by his own insight.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Further, bhikkhus, when the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, then there is not a painful feeling, and the practitioner knows there is a pleasant feeling. When there is a painful feeling, then there is not a pleasant feeling, and the practitioner knows that there is a painful feeling. When there is a neutral feeling, then there is neither a pleasant feeling nor a painful feeling, and the practitioner is aware that the feeling is neither pleasant nor painful. The practitioner is aware of the arising of all dharmas and the disappearance of all dharmas in such a way that, by his own insight, he realizes peace and joy. As feelings arise, the practitioner recognizes and is aware of them and their roots, and he is not dependent on them and does not give rise to feelings of attachment to the world. At that time there is no fear, and having no fear, he liberates himself forever from illusion and realizes nirvana. Birth and death are no longer. The holy life has been lived. What needs to be done has been done. There will be no more rebirth. He understands this directly. This is how the practitioner is aware of the feelings in the feelings to end dispersed thinking and remove sorrow and anxiety. Such is the meditation on the inside of the feelings and the outside of the feelings.\"</p>\n",

When he has hatred in his mind, he knows that he has hatred in his mind. When he does not have hatred, he knows that he does not have hatred. When he has confusion in his mind, he knows that he has confusion in his mind. When he does not have confusion, he knows that he does not have confusion. When he has craving in his mind, he knows that he has craving in his mind. When he does not have craving, he knows that he does not have craving. When there is mastery of his mind, he knows that there is mastery of his mind. When there is no mastery, he knows there is no mastery. When there is dispersion, he knows that there is dispersion. When there is no dispersion, he knows that there is no dispersion. When there is inattention, he knows that there is inattention. When there is no inattention, he knows that there is no inattention. When there is universality, he knows that there is universality. When there is no universality, he knows that there is no universality. When there is extensiveness, he knows that there is extensiveness. When there is not extensiveness, he knows that there is not extensiveness. When there is boundlessness, he knows that there is boundlessness. When there is not boundlessness, he knows that there is not boundlessness.

Because there are no thoughts of attachment to the world, there is no fear. Because there is no fear, there is no residue of affliction. When there is no residue of affliction, nirvana arises, and birth and death are no more, the holy life is realized, what needs to be done has been done, and there will be no more rebirth.

He meditates on the arising of dharmas and the passing of dharmas in order to arrive at peace and joy. He realizes right mindfulness in the present moment. He is able to see, know, and abandon dispersion. He is no longer dependent on anything. He does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because he does not have worldly thoughts, he is not afraid.

      "<p>I.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This section is about the circumstances under which the sutra was delivered, the importance of the sutra, and the subject matter of the sutra, namely the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the first and second versions, it says that the sutra was delivered at Kammassadhamma, in the land of the Kuru people. The third version says that the sutra was delivered in Jetavana Monastery in Sravasti.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In this section, all three versions use the term, \"ekayana\" (the One Vehicle). The third version uses this term in the title of the sutra. The first and second versions use the term, \"nian chu\" (Establishments of Mindfulness) in the title.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A literal translation of the first sentence following the description of the location in the first version of the sutra would say, \"This one way, O bhikkhus, is the way\" or \"This only way, O bhikkhus, is the way.\" (ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggam). The second version says, \"O bhikkhus, there is a way.\" The third version says, \"There is the 'one way in.' Why should it be called 'one way?' Because it refers to our single-mind concentration.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first section of the first version is short and concise. The second version adds that all the Tathagatas of the three times, thanks to their practice of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, were able to overcome the Five Obstacles and realize the path. The third version also mentions the Five Obstacles and says what they are. It also says that the Noble Eightfold Path is a path for practicing the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. In The One Way In Sutra, the Four Establishments of Mindfulness are called the \"Four Practices to Stop and Concentrate the Mind.\" As previously discussed, there is some question whether the translator of the third version is Gautama Sanghadeva or Dharmanandi. If the translator had been Sanghadeva, it is likely he would have used the term \"Four Establishments of Mindfulness,\" as he did in version two.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>II.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This section expounds the ways of observing the body in the body. In the first version, six ways of observing the body are taught:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<canonical-list>\n",
      "<list>\n",
      "    <item>1. Observing the breathing</item>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <item>2. Observing the positions of the body</item>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <item>3. Observing movements and functions of the body</item>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <item>4. Observing the parts of the body</item>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <item>5. Observing the elements in the body</item>\n",
      "\n",
      "    <item>6. Observing a corpse</item>\n",
      "</list>\n",
      "</canonical-list>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the second version, these six ways of observing the body are also taught, but breathing is offered third following the positions and functions of the body. In the observation of a corpse, only five parts are given to this observation instead of the nine in the first version.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The third version teaches only three ways of observing the body. It does not include observing the breathing, the positions, or the functions of the body. There are eight parts to the meditation on observing a corpse.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The unique feature of the second version is that, after the six teachings on how to observe the movements and functions of the body, there is a section that deals with unwholesome thoughts. This section has two parts: how to use a wholesome mind to deal with an unwholesome mind and how to use the mind to restrain the mind, like a strong wrestler holding down a weak man. Both of these ideas come from Vitakkasanthana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 20). We can say with certainty that this part was added at a later date, and in fact was added in an inappropriate place in the sutra, because at this point, the Buddha is discussing the practice of observing the body in the body and has not yet reached the Establishment of Mind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other differences in the second version are teachings on the kind of concentration that gives birth to joy and happiness, which is equivalent to the first jhana, and a concentration that abandons joy but maintains happiness, which is equivalent to the second jhana, as well as meditations on purity, clear light, and signs. All this is evidence that the practice of the Four Jhanas had already begun to infiltrate the Sutra Pitaka, although discreetly. By the time of the third version, the practice of the jhanas is mentioned quite openly, by name. The meditation which observes the clear light can be seen as announcing the first steps in the formation of Pure Land Buddhism, and the meditation on the sign will be developed in the use of the kasina, a symbolic image visualized as a point of concentration.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When it comes to the section that teaches observing mindfully the different elements which constitute the body, the second version mentions six elements as opposed to the usual four elements of the first and third versions. The six elements are earth, water, air, fire, emptiness, and consciousness.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The third version has an additional practice that is the observation of impure elements pouring out from the apertures of the body (not as a part of the Nine Contemplations of the corpse).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the third version, the phrase most often repeated is, \"to arrive at peace and joy.\" The equivalent phrases most repeated in the first and second versions are as follows:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Version One:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is how a practitioner observes the body in the body. He observes the body from within or from without, or from both within and without. He observes the process of coming-to-be in the body or the process of dissolution in the body or both the process of coming-to-be and the process of dissolution. Or he is mindful of the fact, 'There is a body here,' until understanding and full awareness come about. He maintains the observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration. That is how to practice observation of the body in the body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Version Two:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These paragraphs are repeated in the sections of the sutra teaching observation of the feelings, the mind, and the dharmas, substituting the words feelings, mind, or dharmas for the word body. If we are bothered by questions such as \"How can there be an inside of the feelings or an outside of the feelings?\" when we read, \"mindfully observing the feelings in the feelings, observation of the feelings from within or from without, or from both within and without,\" we must remember that repetition, though not always relevant, is a mark of oral transmission. The second version uses the phrase, \"observes the body as the body\" (Chinese: guan shen ru shen) instead of the phrase, \"observes the body in the body\" (Pali: kaye kayanupassana).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>III.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This section concerns the practice of observing the feelings in the feelings. \"Feelings\" is the translation from the Pali vedana in the first version. In the second version the Chinese word used to translate vedana is jue, while in the third version the word used is tong. Why does the third version use tong instead of jue? The original meaning of tong is \"painful.\" Perhaps the translator had been strongly influenced by the doctrine that every single feeling is suffering. In this third section, the third version emphasizes that when there is a painful feeling, there cannot be a pleasant feeling, and when there is a pleasant feeling, there cannot be a painful feeling. It also emphasizes the necessity of observing mindfully the arising and disappearing of feelings and knowing their source in order not to be imprisoned in them or afraid of them. This is a positive point in the third version.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The following is a quotation from the third version: \"Because he is not afraid, he is able to realize nirvana. Birth and death are no more, the holy life has been realized, what needs to be done has been done, there will be no more births.\" This quotation, which is not found in the first and second versions, appears three times in the third version. It is a sentence that is found over and over again in the sutras and most probably during the course of oral transmission it was added here.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>IV.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This section deals with observing the mind in the mind. The third version does not mention mindfulness of the process of the arising and disappearing of psychological phenomena as do the first and second versions. In the third version, it is mentioned that we observe the dharmas that we can know, see, and observe as well as dharmas that we cannot observe. The word \"observe\" here has the meaning of practicing mindful observation. Observing dharmas which cannot be observed is a strange idea, equivalent to the teaching of the Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters, \"Our practice is the practice which is non-practice,\" which has a strong Mahayana flavor.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>An additional quotation of interest from the third version is: \"The practitioner does not rely on anything at all, does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because there is no arising of such thoughts, there is no more fear. Because there is no more fear, no residue of the afflictions is left, and nirvana is realized.\" The latter part of this quotation is nearly equivalent to the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya Sutra: \"Having no obstacles, they overcome fear, liberating themselves forever from illusion and realizing perfect nirvana.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>V.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This part deals with the practice of observing dharmas in dharmas. In the first version, we have the practices of observing the Five Obstacles, the Five Skandhas, the Twelve Realms of Sense Organs and Sense Objects, the Seven Factors of Awakening, and the Four Noble Truths. The first version (in its form in the Digha Nikaya) develops a teaching on the mindful observation of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, and this development is what gives it its name Maha (\"great\") Satipatthana. The second version only teaches mindful observation of the Twelve Realms, the Five Obstacles, and the Seven Factors of Awakening.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The third version only teaches the Seven Factors of Awakening. (It has already dealt with the Five Obstacles in its first section.) Possibly because of carelessness on the part of the copyist, only six of the Seven Factors of Awakening are mentioned: mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, energy, joy, concentration, and equanimity. The third version teaches the Four Jhanas. The terms vitarka and vicara, usually translated as \"initial application\" and \"sustained attention\" are translated into Chinese as jue (\"perception\") and guan (\"observation\"). In this fifth section, the third version repeats the phrases we have already seen in the second and fourth sections and which have been compared with part of the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya Sutra, and adds some words that make it seem even closer to the Prajñaparamita. These words are equivalent to \"liberating themselves forever from illusion\" of the Prajñaparamita.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>VI.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This section deals with the length of time the practitioner needs to realize the fruits of the practice, and it identifies what those fruits are. The first version says that the fruit known as the highest understanding can be reached in this very life, if the practitioner practices the Establishments of Mindfulness. The sutra says that practicing for seven years, five years, down to one month, and half a month, and, finally, seven days, can also result in the highest understanding.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second version goes farther, saying that to practice mindfulness for one day and night can lead to highest awakening, or that if we begin to practice in the morning, by the afternoon the practice will already have results.
