    "<sutra-quote> Further, the practitioner meditates on his very own body from the soles of the feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the body: ‘Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.’</sutra-quote>\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise brings us into even deeper contact with our body. Here we observe the body in all its parts, from the hair on the head to the skin on the soles of the feet. In the process of our observation, we scan all the parts of the body, including the brain, heart, lungs, gall bladder, spleen, blood, urine, and so forth. The Buddha gives us the example of a farmer pouring the contents of a sack filled with a variety of seeds onto the floor and then observing and identifying each kind of seed: “This is rice, these are beans, these are sesame seeds.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We use our conscious breathing in order to observe mindfully all the parts of the body. For example: “Breathing in, I am aware of the hair on my head. Breathing out, I know that this is the hair on my head.” Breathing consciously helps us dwell in mindfulness more easily and sustain the work of observing each part of the body. In addition to the conscious breathing, we can use the method of silently calling each part of the body by name to enable these parts to become increasingly clear in the light of mindfulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to observe in mindfulness the different parts of the body? First of all, it is to be in contact with the body. We often have the impression that we’re already totally in touch with our body, but often we’re wrong. Between us and our body there can be a large separation, and our body remains a stranger to us. Sometimes we hate our body. There are even people who see their body as a prison and a place of punishment. To come back to our body is to become familiar with it and to establish harmony with it. We know that if our body isn’t happy, we’re not happy, and so we want our body to be calm and peaceful. To do so, we come back to our body and make peace with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try touching the different parts of our body to make their acquaintance. We should touch each part in an affectionate and caring way. For several decades, our eyes, feet, and heart have done their work devotedly and faithfully with us and for us, but we never really give them much attention or express our gratitude to them. It’s necessary to establish a close relationship with our body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason for mindfully observing the different parts of the body is that each part can be the door to liberation and awakening. At first we’ll only recognize the presence of the part of the body being observed, but later we’ll come to see its true nature. Every hair on our head and every cell in our body contains the entire universe. Observing the interdependent nature of a single hair can help us to see into the nature of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise of observing every part of the body begins with the hair on the head and goes down to the skin on the soles of the feet. Sometimes we observe just one part of the body deeply, such as our eyes, heart, or toe. In the process of observation from the head to the feet, some observations may spring up in our mind. For example, as we pass our heart, we may think, “My friend John has a heart condition. I must visit him soon to see if he’s all right.” We can note these observations and then continue with the work of observing the remaining parts of the body. Later we can return to those observations.\n",

Because a number of texts, Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese, are cited\\n            throughout the commentary, we use the word sutra as if it were an English word and use\\n            the word sutta only when it is part of the proper name of a Pali sutta, such as\\n            Satipatthana Sutta or Anapanasati Sutta.</p>\\n        <p>The word satipatthana (Sanskrit: smrityupasthana) is a compound of sati, which means\\n            \"mindfulness\" or \"remembering,\" and upatthana, which means \"place of abiding,\"\\n            \"establishment,\" or \"application.\" In Chinese, the title of the sutra is Nian Chu. Nian\\n            is \"to be mindful of,\" \"to put one\\'s attention to,\" or \"to remember.\" Chu means either\\n            \"the dwelling place\" or \"the act of dwelling,\" \"the act of being present,\" \"the act of\\n            establishing oneself.\" Nian Chu therefore may be translated as \"the Four Grounds of\\n            Mindfulness\" or \"the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.\"</p>\\n        <p>For ease of use, the text of the original sutra has been kept with the male pronouns, he\\n            and his, throughout, although clearly the message is intended for practitioners of any\\n            gender.

He breathes in, aware that he is breathing in. He\\n                    breathes out, aware that he is breathing out.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>The first practice is the full awareness of breathing. When we breathe in, we\\n                    know that we are breathing in. When we breathe out, we know that we are\\n                    breathing out. Practicing in this way, our breathing becomes conscious\\n                    breathing. This exercise is simple, yet its effects are profound. To succeed, we\\n                    must put our whole mind into our breathing and nowhere else. As we follow our\\n                    in-breath, for example, we need to be watchful of distracting thoughts. As soon\\n                    as a thought such as, \"I forgot to turn off the light in the kitchen,\" arises,\\n                    our breathing is no longer conscious breathing as we are thinking about\\n                    something else. To succeed, our mind needs to stay focused on our breathing for\\n                    the entire length of each breath. As we breathe, our mind is one with our\\n                    breath, and we become one with our breath. That is the meaning of \"mindfulness\\n                    of the body in the body.\"</p>\\n                <p>Anyone can succeed in the practice of a single conscious breath. If we continue\\n                    to breathe consciously for ten breaths, without our mind going astray, then we\\n                    have taken a valuable step on the path of practice. If we can practice conscious\\n                    breathing for ten minutes, an important change will take place in us. How can a\\n                    practice as simple as this bring about such important results and what are the\\n                    results that it can bring about?</p>\\n                <p>The first result of conscious breathing is returning to ourselves. In everyday\\n                    life, we often get lost in forgetfulness. Our mind chases after thousands of\\n                    things, and we rarely take the time to come back to ourselves. When we have been\\n                    lost in forgetfulness like that for a long time, we lose touch with ourselves,\\n                    and we feel alienated from ourselves. This phenomenon is very common in our\\n                    times. Conscious breathing is a marvelous way to return to ourselves. When we\\n                    are aware of our breath, we come back to ourselves as quick as a flash of\\n                    lightning. Like a child who returns home after a long journey, we feel the\\n                    warmth of our hearth, and we find ourselves again. Coming back to ourselves is\\n                    already a remarkable success on the path of the practice.</p>\\n                <p>The second result of conscious breathing is that we come in contact with life in\\n                    the present moment, the only moment when we can touch life. The life in us and\\n                    around us is wonderful and abundant. If we\\'re not free, we can\\'t be in contact\\n                    with it, and we\\'re not really living our lives. We shouldn\\'t be imprisoned by\\n                    regrets about the past, anxieties for the future, or attachment and aversion in\\n                    the present.</p>\\n                <p>To breathe with full awareness is a miraculous way to untie the knots of regret\\n                    and anxiety and to be in touch with life in the present moment. When we follow\\n                    our breathing, we are already at ease, no longer dominated by our anxieties and\\n                    longings. As we breathe consciously, our breath becomes more regular, and peace\\n                    and joy arise and become more stable with every moment. Relying on our\\n                    breathing, we come back to ourselves and are able to restore the oneness of our\\n                    body and mind. This integration allows us to be in real contact with what is\\n                    happening in the present moment, which is the essence of life.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 2 | Following the Breath</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When he breathes in a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a long\\n                    breath.\\'\\n                    When he breathes out a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out a long\\n                    breath.\\' When he breathes in a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a\\n                    short breath.\\'When he breathes out a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out\\n                    a short breath.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>The practitioner follows his breathing very closely and becomes one with his\\n                    breathing for the entire length of the breath, not allowing any stray thought or\\n                    idea to enter. This method is called \"following the breath.\" While the mind is\\n                    following the breath, the mind is the breath and only the breath. In the process\\n                    of the practice, our breathing naturally becomes more regular, harmonious, and\\n                    calm, and our mind also becomes more regular, harmonious, and calm. This brings\\n                    about feelings of joy, peace, and ease in the body. When the mind and the\\n                    breathing become one, it is only a small step for the body and mind to become\\n                    one also.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 3 | Oneness of Body and Mind</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body.

The element used to\\n                    bring this about is the breath. In meditation practice, the distinction between\\n                    body and mind dissolves, and we talk of the oneness of body and mind. In this\\n                    exercise, the object of our mindfulness is no longer simply the breath, but the\\n                    whole body itself, as it is unified with the breath.</p>\\n                <p>Some practitioners and commentators, because they attach so much importance to\\n                    the realization of the states of concentration (Pali: jhana; Sanskrit: dhyana)\\n                    of the Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas, have explained the term\\n                    \"whole body\" to mean the \"whole breath body\" and not the physical body of the\\n                    practitioner. The Patisambhida Magga, Vimutti Magga, and Visuddhi Magga, all\\n                    well-known commentaries, tell us to concentrate on the tip of our nose, the\\n                    place where the air enters and goes out from the body, as we breathe. We are not\\n                    told to follow our breath into our body, because the commentators fear that our\\n                    body may be too large an object for us to concentrate on. This kind of reasoning\\n                    has led the commentators to interpret the word \"body\" (kaya) in the sutra as\\n                    \"breath body.\" But as we read the sutra, we see that the practice of being\\n                    mindful of the whole \"breath body\" was already dealt with in the second\\n                    exercise: \"Breathing in a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a long\\n                    breath.\\' Breathing out a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out a short\\n                    breath.\\' \" Why then do we need to repeat this exercise?</p>\\n                <p>The first four exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing\\n                    (Anapanasati) teach us to focus our attention on the body, so it is natural for\\n                    the third exercise in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness\\n                    (Satipatthana) also to focus on the full awareness of the physical body. Nowhere\\n                    in either sutra are we taught to concentrate on the breath at the tip of the\\n                    nose. Nowhere are we taught that we shouldn\\'t concentrate on the whole physical\\n                    body.</p>\\n                <p>In recent times, the Burmese meditation master Mahasi Sayadaw taught the method\\n                    of being attentive to the inflation and contraction of the abdomen caused by the\\n                    in-breath and the out-breath. Using this method, the practitioner can realize\\n                    concentration easily, but it isn\\'t described by the Mahasi as a method of\\n                    awareness of breathing. The basic reason for doing this practice, according to\\n                    the Mahasi, is that understanding (prajña) arises naturally when there is\\n                    concentration. Perhaps the reason Mahasi Sayadaw doesn\\'t describe this method as\\n                    a practice of awareness of breathing is because of traditional prejudice that\\n                    conscious breathing should not follow the breath into the body and down into the\\n                    abdomen.</p>\\n                <p>Here it may be useful to say something about the purpose of concentration. Right\\n                    Concentration (samyak samadhi), one stage of the Noble Eightfold Path, leads to\\n                    an awareness and deep observation of the object of concentration and eventually\\n                    to awakened understanding. The Pali compound word samatha-vipassana (Sanskrit:\\n                    samatha-vipashyana) means \"stopping-observing,\" \"calming-illuminating,\" or\\n                    \"concentrating-understanding.\"</p>\\n                <p>There are also states of concentration that encourage the practitioner to escape\\n                    from the complexities of suffering and existence, rather than face them directly\\n                    in order to transform them. These can be called \"wrong concentration.\" The Four\\n                    Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas are states of meditational\\n                    concentration which the Buddha practiced with teachers such as Alara Kalama and\\n                    Uddaka Ramaputta, and he rejected them as not leading to liberation from\\n                    suffering. These states of concentration probably found their way back into the\\n                    sutras around two hundred years after the Buddha passed into mahaparinirvana .\\n                    The results of these concentrations are to hide reality from the practitioner,\\n                    so we can assume that they shouldn\\'t be considered Right Concentration. To dwell\\n                    in these concentrations for a duration of time for the sake of healing may be\\n                    one thing, but to escape in them for a long time isn\\'t what the Buddha\\n                    recommended.</p>\\n                <p>In the third exercise, the practitioner uses her breathing to bring body and mind\\n                    together as one, so the object of concentration is simultaneously body, mind,\\n                    and breath. This condition, known as \"oneness of body and mind,\" is one of total\\n                    integration. In our daily lives, we often find our mind and our body separated.\\n                    Our body may be here, while our mind is somewhere else, perhaps lost in the\\n                    distant past or floating in a distant future. Through mindfulness, we can\\n                    realize the oneness of body and mind, and we\\'re able to restore the wholeness of\\n                    ourselves. In this condition, every practice will take us back to the source,\\n                    which is the oneness of body and mind, and we open to a real encounter with\\n                    life.</p>\\n                <p>When body and mind are one, the wounds in our hearts, minds, and bodies begin to\\n                    heal. As long as there is separation between body and mind, these wounds can\\'t\\n                    heal. During sitting meditation, the three elements of breath, body, and mind\\n                    are calmed, and gradually they become one. When peace is established in one of\\n                    the three elements, the other two will soon have peace also. For example, if the\\n                    body is in a very stable position and all the muscles and the nervous system are\\n                    relaxed, then the mind and breath are immediately influenced, and they too\\n                    gradually become calmed. Similarly, if we practice conscious breathing in the\\n                    right way, our breathing becomes more regular, calm, and harmonious with every\\n                    moment, and this regularity, calmness, and harmony of the breathing will spread\\n                    to our body and mind, and the body and mind will benefit from it. It\\'s only by\\n                    these kinds of processes that the oneness of body and mind will be achieved.\\n                    When there\\'s oneness of body and mind, the breathing serves as \"harmonizer,\" and\\n                    we realize peace, joy, and ease, the first fruits of meditation practice.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 4 | Calming</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I calm my body.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise, a continuation of the third, uses the breath to realize peace and\\n                    calm in our whole body. When our body is not at peace, it\\'s hard for our mind to\\n                    be at peace. Therefore, we should use our breathing to help the functions of our\\n                    body be smooth and peaceful. If we\\'re gasping for breath or if our breath is\\n                    irregular, we can\\'t calm the functions of our body. So the first thing is to\\n                    harmonize our breathing. Our in-breaths and out-breaths should flow smoothly and\\n                    lightly. When our breath is harmonious, our body is also. Our breath needs to be\\n                    light and even and not audible. It should flow smoothly, like a small stream of\\n                    water running down fine sand into the ocean. The more subtle our breath is, the\\n                    more peaceful our body and mind will be. When we breathe in, we can feel the\\n                    breath entering our body and calming all the cells of our body. When we breathe\\n                    out, we feel the exhalation taking with it all our tiredness, irritation, and\\n                    anxiety.</p>\\n                <p>As we breathe, we can recite the following gatha to ourselves:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Breathing in, I calm my body.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out, I smile.</p>\\n                    <p>Dwelling in the present moment,</p>\\n                    <p>I know this is a wonderful moment.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>We know that when we\\'re meditating, body and mind are one, so we only need to\\n                    calm our body in order to calm our mind. When we smile, we demonstrate the peace\\n                    and joy of body and mind. Feelings of peace and joy are the nourishment of the\\n                    practitioner and help the practitioner go far on the path of practice. To learn\\n                    more about this, you are encouraged to practice the fifth and sixth exercises of\\n                    the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. These two exercises are designed\\n                    to help the practitioner nourish herself with the joy of meditational\\n                    concentration. The essence of meditation practice is to come back to dwell in\\n                    the present moment and to observe what is happening in the present moment. \"A\\n                    wonderful moment\" means that the practitioner can see the wonders of life in her\\n                    body, mind, and breathing and can make the feelings of peace and happiness\\n                    stable and strong.</p>\\n                <p>Although we are now discussing the part of the sutra that teaches full awareness\\n                    of the body in the body, since there are very close links between the body and\\n                    the feelings, we should not hesitate to cross freely the boundary between the\\n                    establishment of the body and the establishment of the feelings. As we already\\n                    know, the peace of the body is the peace of the mind.</p>\\n                <p>In exercises three and four, the practitioner follows the breath while returning\\n                    to be one with the body and calming the whole of the body. Obviously, while\\n                    practicing these breathing exercises, all your organs of sense\\n                    perception—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—are closed off so that the\\n                    images of the world around don\\'t come in and agitate the peace within. To return\\n                    to the body in this way is also to return to the mind.</p>\\n                <p>From time to time, we feel tired, and everything we do or say seems to come out\\n                    wrong and create misunderstanding. We may think, \"Today is not my day.\" At times\\n                    like this, it\\'s best simply to return to our body, cut off all contact, and\\n                    close the doors of the senses. Following our breathing, we can collect our mind,\\n                    body, and breath, and they will become one. We will have a feeling of warmth,\\n                    like someone sitting inside by a fireplace while the wind and rain are raging\\n                    outside. This method can be practiced anywhere at any time, not just in the\\n                    meditation hall. We come back in contact with ourselves and make ourselves whole\\n                    again.</p>\\n                <p>We shouldn\\'t think that to close the doors of the sense perceptions is to close\\n                    ourselves off from life and the world, to sever our contact with life. When\\n                    we\\'re not truly ourselves, when we\\'re divided and dispersed, we\\'re not really in\\n                    contact with life. The contact is profound only when we are really ourselves. If\\n                    we\\'re not ourselves in the present moment, when we look at the blue sky, we\\n                    don\\'t really see the blue sky. When we hold the hand of a child, we aren\\'t\\n                    really holding the hand of a child. When we drink tea, we\\'re not really drinking\\n                    tea. Therefore, the wholeness of ourselves is the basis of any meaningful\\n                    contact. We can realize the wholeness of ourselves by means of conscious\\n                    breathing, which brings us back to our body and mind. Realizing the wholeness of\\n                    ourselves is also to renew ourselves in every moment. We become fresh, and\\n                    others enjoy being with us. When we renew ourselves, we see everything else as\\n                    new. The Bamboo Forest Zen Master once said: \"Everything I touch becomes new.\"</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 5 | Positions of the Body</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Moreover, when a practitioner walks, he is aware, \\'I am walking.\\' When\\n                    he is\\n                    standing, he is aware, \\'I am standing.\\' When he is sitting, he is aware, \\'I am\\n                    sitting.\\' When he is lying down, he is aware, \\'I am lying down.\\' In whatever\\n                    position his body happens to be, he is aware of the position of his body.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise is the observation in mindfulness of the positions of the body.\\n                    This is not just an exercise to be practiced at the time of sitting meditation\\n                    or in the meditation hall. The meditation practices taught in the Sutra on the\\n                    Four Establishments of Mindfulness can be used all the day long to help the\\n                    practitioner remain in mindfulness.

Before beginning\\n                    any kind of walking meditation, we can recite the following gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>The mind can go in a thousand directions,</p>\\n                    <p>But on this beautiful path, I walk in peace.</p>\\n                    <p>With each step, a gentle wind blows.</p>\\n                    <p>With each step, a flower blooms.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>Anytime we sit down, we can follow our breath and use this gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Sitting here</p>\\n                    <p>is like sitting under the Bodhi tree.</p>\\n                    <p>My body is mindfulness itself,</p>\\n                    <p>entirely free from distraction.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>We can use our breathing in order to be aware of the positions of sitting and\\n                    standing. When we\\'re standing in a line waiting to buy a ticket, or when we\\'re\\n                    just sitting down and waiting for anything, we can recite the gatha, \"Breathing\\n                    in, I calm my body,\" in order to continue dwelling in mindfulness and to calm\\n                    our body and mind.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 6 | Bodily Actions</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Moreover, when the practitioner is going forward or backward, he\\n                    applies full\\n                    awareness to his going forward or backward. When he looks in front or looks\\n                    behind, bends down or stands up, he also applies full awareness to what he is\\n                    doing. He applies full awareness to wearing the sanghati robe or carrying the\\n                    alms bowl.

This\\n                    is the fundamental practice of the monk. When I was first ordained as a novice\\n                    over sixty years ago, the first book my master gave me to learn by heart was a\\n                    book of short verses (gathas) to be practiced while washing your hands, brushing\\n                    your teeth, washing your face, putting on your clothes, sweeping the courtyard,\\n                    relieving yourself, having a bath, and so on. On hearing the sound of the bell,\\n                    we would breathe consciously and recite this gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Hearing the sound of the bell,</p>\\n                    <p>the afflictions are lifted.</p>\\n                    <p>Understanding grows strong,</p>\\n                    <p>and the awakened mind is born.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>Practicing breathing in combination with reciting a gatha helps us dwell more\\n                    easily in mindfulness. Mindfulness makes every action of our body more serene,\\n                    and we become master of our body and mind. Mindfulness nurtures the power of\\n                    concentration in us. Many of the gathas in the book I was given, Gathas for\\n                    Everyday Use, a text by Chinese master Du Ti, were taken from the Avatamsaka\\n                    Sutra. I have written a book of gathas in the same spirit, Present Moment,\\n                    Wonderful Moment.<footnote-ref id=\"2\">2</footnote-ref> These gathas are very\\n                    easy to use and can also be combined with conscious breathing.</p>\\n                <p>Without mindfulness, our actions are often hurried and abrupt. As we practice the\\n                    sixth exercise, we may find that our actions slow down. If a novice applies\\n                    himself to the practice of the sixth exercise, he\\'ll see that his everyday\\n                    actions become harmonious, graceful, and measured. Mindfulness becomes visible\\n                    in his actions and speech. When any action is placed in the light of\\n                    mindfulness, the body and mind become relaxed, peaceful, and joyful. The sixth\\n                    exercise is one to be used day and night throughout our entire life.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 7| Parts of the Body</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, the practitioner meditates on his very own body from the soles\\n                    of the\\n                    feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body\\n                    contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the\\n                    body: \\'Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth,\\n                    skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm,\\n                    spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat,\\n                    fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise brings us into even deeper contact with our body. Here we observe\\n                    the body in all its parts, from the hair on the head to the skin on the soles of\\n                    the feet. In the process of our observation, we scan all the parts of the body,\\n                    including the brain, heart, lungs, gall bladder, spleen, blood, urine, and so\\n                    forth. The Buddha gives us the example of a farmer pouring the contents of a\\n                    sack filled with a variety of seeds onto the floor and then observing and\\n                    identifying each kind of seed: \"This is rice, these are beans, these are sesame\\n                    seeds.\"</p>\\n                <p>We use our conscious breathing in order to observe mindfully all the parts of the\\n                    body. For example: \"Breathing in, I am aware of the hair on my head. Breathing\\n                    out, I know that this is the hair on my head.\" Breathing consciously helps us\\n                    dwell in mindfulness more easily and sustain the work of observing each part of\\n                    the body. In addition to the conscious breathing, we can use the method of\\n                    silently calling each part of the body by name to enable these parts to become\\n                    increasingly clear in the light of mindfulness.</p>\\n                <p>Why do we need to observe in mindfulness the different parts of the body? First\\n                    of all, it is to be in contact with the body. We often have the impression that\\n                    we\\'re already totally in touch with our body, but often we\\'re wrong. Between us\\n                    and our body there can be a large separation, and our body remains a stranger to\\n                    us. Sometimes we hate our body. There are even people who see their body as a\\n                    prison and a place of punishment. To come back to our body is to become familiar\\n                    with it and to establish harmony with it. We know that if our body isn\\'t happy,\\n                    we\\'re not happy, and so we want our body to be calm and peaceful. To do so, we\\n                    come back to our body and make peace with it.</p>\\n                <p>We can try touching the different parts of our body to make their acquaintance.\\n                    We should touch each part in an affectionate and caring way. For several\\n                    decades, our eyes, feet, and heart have done their work devotedly and faithfully\\n                    with us and for us, but we never really give them much attention or express our\\n                    gratitude to them. It\\'s necessary to establish a close relationship with our\\n                    body.</p>\\n                <p>The second reason for mindfully observing the different parts of the body is that\\n                    each part can be the door to liberation and awakening. At first we\\'ll only\\n                    recognize the presence of the part of the body being observed, but later we\\'ll\\n                    come to see its true nature. Every hair on our head and every cell in our body\\n                    contains the entire universe. Observing the interdependent nature of a single\\n                    hair can help us to see into the nature of the universe.</p>\\n                <p>The exercise of observing every part of the body begins with the hair on the head\\n                    and goes down to the skin on the soles of the feet. Sometimes we observe just\\n                    one part of the body deeply, such as our eyes, heart, or toe. In the process of\\n                    observation from the head to the feet, some observations may spring up in our\\n                    mind. For example, as we pass our heart, we may think, \"My friend John has a\\n                    heart condition. I must visit him soon to see if he\\'s all right.\" We can note\\n                    these observations and then continue with the work of observing the remaining\\n                    parts of the body. Later we can return to those observations.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 8 | Body and Universe</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, in whichever position his body happens to be, the practitioner\\n                    passes in\\n                    review the elements which constitute the body: \\'In this body is the earth\\n                    element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise shows us the interrelationship of our body and all that is in the\\n                    universe. It\\'s one of the principal ways of witnessing for ourselves the\\n                    nonself, unborn, and never-dying nature of all that is. Seeing things in this\\n                    way can liberate and awaken us.</p>\\n                <p>The sutra teaches us that we should be aware of the presence of earth, water,\\n                    fire, and air elements in our body. These are the Four Great Elements (Sanskrit:\\n                    mahabhuta), also referred to as the realms (Sanskrit: dhatu). The earth element\\n                    represents the hard, solid nature of matter. The water element represents the\\n                    liquid, permeating nature. The fire element represents heat, and the air element\\n                    represents movement. The Dhatuvibhanga Sutra and the second version of the sutra\\n                    on mindfulness in this book both refer to six elements—the two additional\\n                    elements are space (Sanskrit: akasa) and consciousness (Sanskrit: vijñana).</p>\\n                <p>Our bodies are more than three-fourths water. When the practitioner looks deeply\\n                    in order to see the water in his body, not only does he see the liquid,\\n                    permeating nature of the blood, sweat, saliva, tears, and urine, but he also\\n                    sees the water element in every cell of his body. There are clouds in the body,\\n                    because without clouds there can be no rain, and we won\\'t have any water to\\n                    drink or grains and vegetables to eat. We see earth in us, earth as the minerals\\n                    in our body. We also see that earth is alive in us because, thanks to Mother\\n                    Earth, we have food to eat. We see air in us, air representing movement. Without\\n                    air we could not survive, since we, as every other species on Earth, need air to\\n                    live.</p>\\n                <p>The practitioner observes her body mindfully to see all that is in it and to see\\n                    the interrelated nature of herself and the universe. She sees that his life is\\n                    not just present in her own body, and she transcends the erroneous view that\\n                    she\\'s just her body. In the book The Sun My Heart, I refer to the sun as our\\n                    second heart, a heart which lies outside our body but which is as essential for\\n                    our body as the heart inside our body.<footnote-ref id=\"3\">3</footnote-ref> When\\n                    the heart inside the body ceases to function, we know very well that we will\\n                    die, but we often forget that if the heart outside our body, the sun, ceases to\\n                    function, we will also die immediately. When we observe mindfully the\\n                    interdependent nature of our body, we see our life outside our body, and we\\n                    transcend the boundary between self and nonself. This practice of mindful\\n                    observation helps us go beyond such limiting concepts as birth and death.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 9 | Body As Impermanent</title>\\n                <section level=\"4\" type=\"canonical-list\">\\n                    <title>The Nine Contemplations (the nine stages of decomposition of a corpse):</title>\\n                    <list>\\n                        <item>1.

When we first read this, we may feel that this is not a pleasant\\n                    meditation. But the effect of this practice can be very great. It can be\\n                    liberating and can bring us much peace and joy. The practitioner observes\\n                    mindfully in order to see the corpse at each of these stages and to see that it\\n                    is inevitable that her own body will pass through the same stages.</p>\\n                <p>In former times, practitioners would actually sit in cemeteries and observe\\n                    corpses in these various stages of decomposition. Of course, today, decomposing\\n                    bodies aren\\'t exposed for us to view. But we can visualize them according to the\\n                    description in the sutra. This exercise should be practiced by those who are in\\n                    good mental and physical health. It shouldn\\'t be practiced by those who have not\\n                    yet mastered desire and aversion. Its intention is not to make us weary of life,\\n                    but to help us see how precious life is; not to make us pessimistic, but to help\\n                    us see the impermanent nature of life so that we don\\'t waste our lives. If we\\n                    have the courage to see things as they are, our meditation will have beneficial\\n                    results. When we see the impermanent nature of things, we appreciate their true\\n                    value.</p>\\n                <p>Have you ever stayed up at night to see a Cereus cactus flower open? The flower\\n                    opens and dies in a few hours, but because we\\'re aware of that, we appreciate\\n                    its wondrous fragrance and beauty. We can be in real contact with the flower and\\n                    not be sad or depressed when it fades, because we knew before it opened how\\n                    ephemeral its life was.</p>\\n                <p>Our dear ones who live with us and the beautiful and precious beings around us\\n                    are all wonderful cactus flowers. If we can see their true nature as well as\\n                    their outward form, we will know how to value their presence in the present\\n                    moment. If we know how to value them, we\\'ll have the time to be in real contact\\n                    with them, and we\\'ll take care of them, make them happy, and therefore be\\n                    happier ourselves.</p>\\n                <p>These Nine Contemplations help us see the preciousness of life.

When we observe\\n                    the body this way, we are in direct contact with it, and we are able to see the\\n                    process of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be in the constituents that comprise the\\n                    body. In the first version of the sutra, at the end of each meditation exercise\\n                    to observe the body in the body, we read:</p>\\n                <p>This is how the practitioner remains established in the observation of the body\\n                    in the body, observation of the body from within or from without, or observation\\n                    of the body from both within and without. He remains established in the\\n                    observation of the process of coming-to-be in the body or the process of\\n                    dissolution in the body or both the process of coming-to-be and the process of\\n                    dissolution. Or he is mindful of the fact, \\'There is a body here,\\' until\\n                    understanding and full awareness come about. He remains established in the\\n                    observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration.</p>\\n                <p>We should remember that the breathing, the positions of the body, the movements\\n                    of the body, and the parts of the body all belong to the body and are the body.\\n                    To be in touch with these aspects and to be able to see the process of birth and\\n                    death and the nonself and interdependent nature of the body is the meaning of\\n                    mindful observation of the body.</p>\\n                <p>Therefore, the teachings of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependent\\n                    origination—the three basic observations of Buddhism—are realized\\n                    directly through the practice of the nine exercises for mindfully observing the\\n                    body. These nine exercises can liberate and awaken us to the way things are.</p>\\n                <p>In the second version of the sutra, the description of each body meditation\\n                    exercise is as follows:</p>\\n                <p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both within and without,\\n                    and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity,\\n                    and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\\n                <p>The words recognition, insight, clarity, and realization here mean that the\\n                    practitioner recognizes, sees, sheds light on, and realizes the impermanent and\\n                    interdependent nature of the body and all that is, by means of the mindful\\n                    observation of the body.</p>\\n                <p>Observing the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of all that is\\n                    doesn\\'t lead us to feel aversion for life. On the contrary, it helps us see the\\n                    preciousness of all that lives. Liberation doesn\\'t mean running away from or\\n                    destroying life. Many people present Buddhism as a path that denies life, that\\n                    transcends the world of the Five Aggregates (Sanskrit: skandha) of form,\\n                    feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. To present Buddhism\\n                    in this way is no different from saying that the object of our practice is to\\n                    arrive at the absence of life or nothingness.</p>\\n                <p>In the Dhammacakka Sutta, the first Dharma talk given by the Buddha in the Deer\\n                    Park, the Buddha taught that to be attached to existence (Sanskrit: bhava) is no\\n                    worse than to be attached to nonexistence (Sanskrit: abhava). In the Kaccayana\\n                    Gotta Sutta, the Buddha also taught that reality is not to be found in terms of\\n                    existence or nonexistence. His meaning is perfectly clear: suffering is not\\n                    brought about by life, the Five Skandhas, or the selfless and interdependent\\n                    nature of all that is. The cause of ill-being is our ignorance. Because we\\'re\\n                    not able to see that the true nature of life is impermanence, selflessness, and\\n                    interdependence, we become attached to things, believing that they\\'re permanent.\\n                    From this thinking arise the roots of affliction and the internal formations or\\n                    knots: craving, hatred, pride, doubt, and so forth. Impermanence, selflessness,\\n                    and interdependence are the essential conditions for life. Without impermanence,\\n                    how can the corn seed become a corn plant and how can the baby grow up and go to\\n                    school?</p>\\n                <p>In fact, it\\'s because of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence that\\n                    things come into existence, mature, decay, and cease to be. Birth, decay, and\\n                    ceasing to be are the necessary steps of the lives of all species. Presenting\\n                    impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence as problematic, we senselessly\\n                    make life unacceptable. We need to do the opposite; we need to praise them as\\n                    essential elements of life. Only when we\\'re not able to recognize these\\n                    attributes as they are do we get caught in the knots of attachment and sorrow.</p>\\n                <p>The Ratnakuta Sutra gives the example of someone who throws a clod of earth at a\\n                    dog. When the clod hits the dog, he runs after it and barks furiously at it. The\\n                    dog doesn\\'t know that the thing responsible for his pain isn\\'t the clod of earth\\n                    but the man who threw it. The sutra teaches:</p>\\n                <p>In the same way, the ordinary man caught in dualistic conceptions is accustomed\\n                    to thinking that the Five Aggregates are the root of his suffering, but in fact\\n                    the root of suffering is the lack of understanding about the impermanent,\\n                    selfless, and interdependent nature of the Five Aggregates.</p>\\n                <p>Because we don\\'t understand correctly, we become attached to things, and then\\n                    we\\'re caught by them. In the sutra, the term \"aggregate\" (Pali: khanda;\\n                    Sanskrit: skandha) and the term \"aggregate of clinging\" (Pali: upadanakkhanda;\\n                    Sanskrit: upadanaskandha) are used. Skandhas are the five elements that give\\n                    rise to life, and the upadana skandhas are the five elements as objects of\\n                    attachment. The root of suffering isn\\'t the skandhas but the attachment that\\n                    binds us. There are people who, because of their incorrect understanding of what\\n                    the root of suffering is, instead of dealing with their attitude of attachment,\\n                    think they have to deal with their organs of sense and the aggregates, and so\\n                    they fear form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and objects of mind and feel\\n                    aversion for the body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and\\n                    consciousness.</p>\\n                <p>The Buddha was someone who, because he wasn\\'t attached to things, lived in peace,\\n                    joy, and freedom with a healthy and fresh vigor. He always had a smile on his\\n                    lips, and his presence created a fresh atmosphere around him. There are many\\n                    stories in the sutras which show how much the Buddha loved life and knew how to\\n                    appreciate the beautiful things around him. On many occasions, he pointed out\\n                    beautiful scenery to Ananda, such as the sun setting on Vulture Peak, the golden\\n                    rice fields surrounded by green paths, the fresh green landscape of the Bamboo\\n                    Forest Monastery, and the lovely town of Vaisali. The Buddha was not afraid of\\n                    beautiful things, because he was able to see the impermanent nature of\\n                    everything, beautiful or ugly. He didn\\'t chase after things, and he didn\\'t run\\n                    away from them either. The way of freedom isn\\'t running away from the Five\\n                    Aggregates, but coming face to face with them in order to understand their true\\n                    nature.</p>\\n                <p>If we cut flowers from our garden to place on the altar, that is because we\\n                    acknowledge the beauty of those flowers. All we can say is, \"Although these\\n                    flowers are beautiful, their beauty is fragile. When, in a few days time, these\\n                    flowers die, their beauty will die with them.\" We understand this, and when the\\n                    flowers wilt in a few days, we won\\'t suffer or feel sad. Because we can see the\\n                    impermanent nature of the flowers, we can appreciate all the more the beauty of\\n                    each flower. To observe the impermanence of things is not to reject them, but to\\n                    be in contact with them with deep understanding, without being caught in desire\\n                    and attachment.</p>\\n                <p>Freedom in Buddhism is the freedom which comes about by being awake and\\n                    understanding. A practitioner doesn\\'t need to struggle with desire. The two\\n                    basic meditation sutras, the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and\\n                    the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, both shed light on this principle:\\n                    \"When his mind is desiring something, the practitioner is aware, \\'My mind is\\n                    desiring\\'\" (Satipatthana Sutta), and \"Breathing in, I am aware of the functions\\n                    of my mind\" (Anapanasati Sutta). In identifying the mind of desire, in observing\\n                    the nature of that mind and the nature of the object of desire, we\\'ll see the\\n                    impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence of it, and we\\'ll no longer be\\n                    dominated by that state of mind.</p>\\n                <p>For many generations, some Buddhists have presented Buddhism as a path that\\n                    destroys desire, and they have described liberated persons as emaciated arhats\\n                    with wrinkled skin and no vitality. We should define what is meant by desire. If\\n                    we\\'ve had nothing to eat for three days, we feel like eating. Is that desire? Is\\n                    the natural desire for the indispensable elements of life a desire we need to\\n                    destroy? To eat when hungry, to drink when thirsty, is that to go against the\\n                    path which leads to emancipation? But if so, then Buddhism would be a path that\\n                    flees from and destroys life.</p>\\n                <p>We know very well that to eat and drink enough are necessary to nourish our body\\n                    and keep us strong. We also know that eating and drinking excessively can\\n                    destroy our bodies. So we can say that to eat and drink so that the body is\\n                    strong and healthy is to walk on the path of emancipation, while to eat and\\n                    drink in a way that causes our body and others to suffer is to go against the\\n                    way of liberation. In the first case desire isn\\'t present, in the second case\\n                    desire is present.</p>\\n                <p>Other Buddhists have opposed the image of the emaciated arhat destroying desire\\n                    and have described liberated persons as fresh, healthy bodhisattvas, beautiful\\n                    to look at and full of vigor. The image of the bodhisattva is very close to the\\n                    image of the Buddha entering life with a heart of love and compassion and a\\n                    smile on his lips. Although the Buddha enjoyed the solitary life, he never\\n                    refused to go deeply into the world in order to help living beings.</p>\\n                <p>To know how to appreciate a beautiful sunset is not desire, if we \"remain\\n                    established in the observation, free and not caught up in any worldly\\n                    consideration\" (Satipatthana Sutta). If we are able to see impermanence,\\n                    selflessness, and interdependence, we are awake. To swim in a cool stream, to\\n                    drink a glass of clear water, to eat a sweet orange, and to know how to\\n                    appreciate the coolness, the clarity, and the sweetness, is not desire if we are\\n                    not attached to these things. In the Southern tradition of Buddhism, and to some\\n                    extent in the Northern tradition, generations of Buddhists have expressed fear\\n                    of peace and joy and have not dared to practice peace and joy. The tenth\\n                    exercise is taken from the second version of the sutra (see Appendix). It is a\\n                    practice of peace and joy.</p>\\n            </section> <!-- section level 2 remarks\\n            on first nine exercises -->\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 10 | Healing with Joy</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body as body, when,\\n                    thanks to\\n                    having put aside the Five Desires, a feeling of bliss arises during his\\n                    concentration and saturates every part of his body.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of body as body, feels the joy\\n                    which arises during concentration saturate every part of his body.

Please read the following excerpt from\\n                    the second version:</p>\\n                <p>Like the bath attendant, who, after putting powdered soap into a basin, mixes it\\n                    with water until the soap paste has water in every part of it, so the\\n                    practitioner feels the bliss that is born when the desires of the sense realms\\n                    are put aside, saturate every part of his body.</p>\\n                <p>The feeling of joy that\\'s born when the practitioner lets go of his life of\\n                    agitation, desire, and hatred will strengthen and penetrate more deeply when he\\n                    has mastered the way of applying his mind:</p>\\n                <p>Like a spring within a mountain whose clear, pure water flows out and down all\\n                    sides of that mountain and bubbles up in places where water has not previously\\n                    entered, saturating the entire mountain, in the same way joy, born during\\n                    concentration, permeates the whole of the practitioner\\'s body; it is present\\n                    everywhere.</p>\\n                <p>When the state of happiness is really present, the joy of the mind settles down\\n                    to allow happiness to become steadier and deeper. For as long as the joy is\\n                    still there, there goes with it, to a greater or lesser extent,\\n                    conceptualization and excitement. \"Joy\" is a translation of the Sanskrit word\\n                    piti, and \"happiness\" is a translation of sukha. The following example is often\\n                    used to compare joy with happiness: Someone traveling in the desert who sees a\\n                    stream of cool water experiences joy. When he drinks the water, he experiences\\n                    happiness.</p>\\n                <p>Just as the different species of blue, pink, red, and white lotus, which grow up\\n                    from the bottom of a pond of clear water and appear on the surface of that pond,\\n                    have their tap roots, subsidiary roots, leaves, and flowers all full of the\\n                    water of that pond, and there is no part of the plant which does not contain the\\n                    water, so the feeling of happiness which arises with the disappearance of joy\\n                    permeates the whole of the practitioner\\'s body, and there is no part which it\\n                    does not penetrate.</p>\\n                <p>At the time of the meditation, the practitioner feels happy and at peace. He lets\\n                    his consciousness of this peace and happiness embrace his whole body, so that\\n                    his body is saturated by it:</p>\\n                <p>Just as someone who puts on a very long robe which reaches from his head to his\\n                    feet, and there is no part of his body which is not covered by this robe, so the\\n                    practitioner with a clear, calm mind envelops his whole body in understanding\\n                    and leaves no part of the body uncovered. This is how the practitioner is aware\\n                    of the body as the body, both within and without, and establishes mindfulness in\\n                    the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called\\n                    being aware of the body as the body.</p>\\n                <p>As we\\'ve already seen, the function of this exercise is to nourish us with joy\\n                    and happiness and to heal the wounds within us. But we have no doubts about\\n                    letting go of this joy in order to embark on the work of observation. Joy and\\n                    happiness come about because of physical and psychological conditions and are as\\n                    impermanent as all other physical and psychological phenomena. Only when, thanks\\n                    to mindful observation, we realize the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent\\n                    nature of all that is, can we achieve freedom and liberation.</p>\\n            </section> <!--\\n            section level 3 exercise -->\\n        </section> '"

But his teachings spread far beyond the area where that language was\\n                spoken, and there is no doubt that in the practice centers that lay beyond the\\n                alluvial plain of the Ganges River, the monks and nuns would have studied the Dharma\\n                in their own local languages. One day in the Jetavana monastery, two monks, Yamelu\\n                and Tekula, asked the Buddha if they could translate all his teachings into the\\n                classical meter of the Vedic language. They told the Buddha that they wanted to do\\n                so in order to protect the beauty and accuracy of the Dharma. But the Buddha did not\\n                want his teachings to become a precious object reserved for a scholarly elite. He\\n                wanted everyone to be able to study and practice the Dharma in her own language.</p>\\n            <p>About four months after the passing of the Buddha, the Venerable Mahakasyapa convened\\n                a council on Mount Saptaparnaguha at Rajgir in order to orally collate the Sutra and\\n                Vinaya Pitakas. Five hundred elder bhikkhus were invited to attend this Collation\\n                Council, which was sponsored by King Ajatasatru of Magadha. The language of the\\n                collation would naturally have been Ardhamagadhi, the language of the Buddha. If the\\n                local districts later developed versions in their own languages, these would have\\n                been based on the collation of the Rajgir Council.</p>\\n            <p>One hundred years later, a second council was convened in Vaisali to further collate\\n                the canon of the Buddha\\'s teachings. On this occasion, seven hundred bhikkhus were\\n                invited to attend. After the Second Council, in 375 BCE, the community of bhikkhus\\n                divided itself into two schools: the Sthavira, which tended to be conservative, and\\n                the Mahasanghika, which tended to promote development and reform. The followers of\\n                the Mahasanghika were more numerous. In the three hundred years that followed, many\\n                other schools branched off from these two schools. According to the\\n                Samayabhedoparacanacakra by Vasumitra, who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of\\n                the Northern tradition, there were eighteen schools in all.</p>\\n            <p>The number of schools proliferated because of the many different ways of\\n                understanding and commenting on the teachings of the Buddha. The works in which\\n                these explanations are contained are called the Abhidharma and belong to the Sastra\\n                Pitaka. Each school has handed down its own versions of the Vinaya, Sutra, and\\n                Sastra Pitakas. All three pitakas of the Theravada school are intact thanks to the\\n                relatively stable ground for practice in Sri Lanka. The Tripitaka of this school is\\n                written in the Pali language, which originated in western India. The Theravada arose\\n                from the Vibhajyavada, which was a school opposing the Sarvastivada.</p>\\n            <p>A third council was organized at Pataliputra under the patronage of King Asoka in 244\\n                BCE, two hundred thirty-six years after the passing of the Buddha. At that time,\\n                perhaps because King Asoka leaned more towards the Vibhajyavada sect, the\\n                Sarvastivadins moved to the north and established their base for development in\\n                Kashmir, where they flourished for more than one thousand years.</p>\\n            <p>Three versions of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness have come down\\n                to us. The main version presented in this book is a translation from the Pali\\n                Satipatthana Sutta (number 10 in the Majjhima Nikaya), a first century BCE scripture\\n                of the Theravada School. This version is exactly the same as the Pali\\n                Mahasatipatthana Sutta (number 20 in the Digha Nikaya), except that the latter has a\\n                little more text at the end. For purposes of this commentary, the Mahasatipatthana\\n                Sutta is regarded as version one.</p>\\n            <p>The second and third versions are from the Chinese Canon. The second version, the\\n                Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness, is a translation of the Nian Chu Jing\\n                (number 98 in the Madhyama Agama and number 26 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka) of\\n                the Sarvastivada school, translated into Chinese from the Sanskrit Smrtyupasthana\\n                Sutra. The third version, The One Way In Sutra, is a translation of the Yi Ru Dao\\n                Jing (Ekottara Agama, sutra number 125 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka). It comes\\n                from the Mahasanghika school, not in its original but in its later form.</p>\\n            <p>In the Chinese Canon, the name of the translator of the Sutra on the Four Grounds of\\n                Mindfulness is given as Gautama Sanghadeva. Master Sanghadeva came from what is now\\n                Afghanistan and traveled to China in the fourth century, living from the year 383 in\\n                the capital Chang An, and after that in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin. He\\n                began the work of translation between 391 and 398. He probably had learned Chinese\\n                when he lived in Chang An.</p>\\n            <p>The Chinese Canon also ascribes the translation of The One Way In Sutra to Gautama\\n                Sanghadeva. However, there are many reasons for thinking that the sutra was\\n                translated by the monk Dharmanandi. Master Dharmanandi was Khotanese. He traveled to\\n                China in the fourth century and took up residence in Chang An, where he translated\\n                sutras from 384-391. The book Marking the Era of Buddhism (K\\'ai Yuan Shi Pi Chiao\\n                Lu) says that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Sanghadeva. Master Tao An, in his\\n                introduction to The One Way In Sutra, says that it was Master Dharmanandi who read\\n                the original Sanskrit version for Zhu Fo Nian to translate into Chinese and for\\n                Gautama Sanghadeva to write down. After that, they brought the translated version to\\n                be examined by the translation school of Master Sanghadeva in Jian Kang, the capital\\n                of Dong Chin.</p>\\n            <p>The Li Tai San Pao Chi, Volume 7 (Sui Dynasty), the Ta T\\'ang Nei Tien Lu, and the Ta\\n                T\\'ang Ch\\'an Ting Chung Ching Mu Lu, all say that there were two translations of the\\n                Ekottara Agama, one by Master Dharmanandi and one by Master Sanghadeva. The books\\n                Ch\\'u San Tsang Chi Chi and the Chung Ching Mu Lu of the Sui Dynasty, and the Sutra\\n                Index of the T\\'ang Dynasty, all say that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Master\\n                Dharmanandi. Judging from all of this information and from the literary style of the\\n                text, we conclude that there was only one translation of the Ekottara Agama, the\\n                translation of Master Dharmanandi.</p>\\n            <p>The Mahasanghika school, which came into existence after the council at Vaisali,\\n                later divided into two branches, one going to the northwest and one to the south.\\n                There were five branches of Mahasanghika in the northwest, including the\\n                Lokottaravada, which was Mahayana in outlook. It was the Ekottara Agama of this\\n                branch, including the third version of the sutra on mindfulness presented in this\\n                book, that Dharmanandi translated. Therefore, our third version is more influenced\\n                by the Mahayana and can be said to be less close to the original teaching of the\\n                Buddha than the first two versions, because many later elements have infiltrated\\n                into it. Still, it contains the essence of the original teachings.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"sutra\">\\n            <title>VERSION TWO: SUTRA ON THE FOUR GROUNDS OF MINDFULNESS</title>\\n            <sutra-source>Nian Chu Jing (Sarvastivada) from Madhya Agama (number 26 in Taisho\\n                Revised Tripitaka).

The third version says that the\\n                sutra was delivered in Jetavana Monastery in Sravasti.</p>\\n            <p>In this section, all three versions use the term, \"ekayana\" (the One Vehicle). The\\n                third version uses this term in the title of the sutra. The first and second\\n                versions use the term, \"nian chu\" (Establishments of Mindfulness) in the title.</p>\\n            <p>A literal translation of the first sentence following the description of the location\\n                in the first version of the sutra would say, \"This one way, O bhikkhus, is the way\"\\n                or \"This only way, O bhikkhus, is the way.\" (ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggam). The\\n                second version says, \"O bhikkhus, there is a way.\" The third version says, \"There is\\n                the \\'one way in.\\' Why should it be called \\'one way?\\' Because it refers to our\\n                single-mind concentration.\"</p>\\n            <p>The first section of the first version is short and concise. The second version adds\\n                that all the Tathagatas of the three times, thanks to their practice of the Four\\n                Establishments of Mindfulness, were able to overcome the Five Obstacles and realize\\n                the path. The third version also mentions the Five Obstacles and says what they are.\\n                It also says that the Noble Eightfold Path is a path for practicing the Four\\n                Establishments of Mindfulness. In The One Way In Sutra, the Four Establishments of\\n                Mindfulness are called the \"Four Practices to Stop and Concentrate the Mind.\" As\\n                previously discussed, there is some question whether the translator of the third\\n                version is Gautama Sanghadeva or Dharmanandi. If the translator had been Sanghadeva,\\n                it is likely he would have used the term \"Four Establishments of Mindfulness,\" as he\\n                did in version two.</p>\\n            <p>II.</p>\\n            <p>This section expounds the ways of observing the body in the body. In the first\\n                version, six ways of observing the body are taught:</p>\\n            <canonical-list>\\n                <list>\\n                    <item>1. Observing the breathing</item>\\n                    <item>2. Observing the positions of the body</item>\\n                    <item>3. Observing movements and functions of the body</item>\\n                    <item>4. Observing the parts of the body</item>\\n                    <item>5. Observing the elements in the body</item>\\n                    <item>6. Observing a corpse</item>\\n                </list>\\n            </canonical-list>\\n            <p>In the second version, these six ways of observing the body are also taught, but\\n                breathing is offered third following the positions and functions of the body. In the\\n                observation of a corpse, only five parts are given to this observation instead of\\n                the nine in the first version.</p>\\n            <p>The third version teaches only three ways of observing the body. It does not include\\n                observing the breathing, the positions, or the functions of the body. There are\\n                eight parts to the meditation on observing a corpse.</p>\\n            <p>The unique feature of the second version is that, after the six teachings on how to\\n                observe the movements and functions of the body, there is a section that deals with\\n                unwholesome thoughts. This section has two parts: how to use a wholesome mind to\\n                deal with an unwholesome mind and how to use the mind to restrain the mind, like a\\n                strong wrestler holding down a weak man. Both of these ideas come from\\n                Vitakkasanthana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 20). We can say with certainty that this part\\n                was added at a later date, and in fact was added in an inappropriate place in the\\n                sutra, because at this point, the Buddha is discussing the practice of observing the\\n                body in the body and has not yet reached the Establishment of Mind.</p>\\n            <p>Other differences in the second version are teachings on the kind of concentration\\n                that gives birth to joy and happiness, which is equivalent to the first jhana, and a\\n                concentration that abandons joy but maintains happiness, which is equivalent to the\\n                second jhana, as well as meditations on purity, clear light, and signs. All this is\\n                evidence that the practice of the Four Jhanas had already begun to infiltrate the\\n                Sutra Pitaka, although discreetly. By the time of the third version, the practice of\\n                the jhanas is mentioned quite openly, by name. The meditation which observes the\\n                clear light can be seen as announcing the first steps in the formation of Pure Land\\n                Buddhism, and the meditation on the sign will be developed in the use of the kasina,\\n                a symbolic image visualized as a point of concentration.</p>\\n            <p>When it comes to the section that teaches observing mindfully the different elements\\n                which constitute the body, the second version mentions six elements as opposed to\\n                the usual four elements of the first and third versions. The six elements are earth,\\n                water, air, fire, emptiness, and consciousness.</p>\\n            <p>The third version has an additional practice that is the observation of impure\\n                elements pouring out from the apertures of the body (not as a part of the Nine\\n                Contemplations of the corpse).</p>\\n            <p>In the third version, the phrase most often repeated is, \"to arrive at peace and\\n                joy.\" The equivalent phrases most repeated in the first and second versions are as\\n                follows:</p>\\n            <p>Version One:</p>\\n            <p>This is how a practitioner observes the body in the body. He observes the body from\\n                within or from without, or from both within and without. He observes the process of\\n                coming-to-be in the body or the process of dissolution in the body or both the\\n                process of coming-to-be and the process of dissolution. Or he is mindful of the\\n                fact, \\'There is a body here,\\' until understanding and full awareness come about. He\\n                maintains the observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration. That is\\n                how to practice observation of the body in the body.</p>\\n            <p>Version Two:</p>\\n            <p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and\\n                outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight,\\n                clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\\n            <p>These paragraphs are repeated in the sections of the sutra teaching observation of\\n                the feelings, the mind, and the dharmas, substituting the words feelings, mind, or\\n                dharmas for the word body. If we are bothered by questions such as \"How can there be\\n                an inside of the feelings or an outside of the feelings?\" when we read, \"mindfully\\n                observing the feelings in the feelings, observation of the feelings from within or\\n                from without, or from both within and without,\" we must remember that repetition,\\n                though not always relevant, is a mark of oral transmission. The second version uses\\n                the phrase, \"observes the body as the body\" (Chinese: guan shen ru shen) instead of\\n                the phrase, \"observes the body in the body\" (Pali: kaye kayanupassana).</p>\\n            <p>III.</p>\\n            <p>This section concerns the practice of observing the feelings in the feelings.\\n                \"Feelings\" is the translation from the Pali vedana in the first version. In the\\n                second version the Chinese word used to translate vedana is jue, while in the third\\n                version the word used is tong. Why does the third version use tong instead of jue?\\n                The original meaning of tong is \"painful.\" Perhaps the translator had been strongly\\n                influenced by the doctrine that every single feeling is suffering. In this third\\n                section, the third version emphasizes that when there is a painful feeling, there\\n                cannot be a pleasant feeling, and when there is a pleasant feeling, there cannot be\\n                a painful feeling. It also emphasizes the necessity of observing mindfully the\\n                arising and disappearing of feelings and knowing their source in order not to be\\n                imprisoned in them or afraid of them. This is a positive point in the third version.</p>\\n            <p>The following is a quotation from the third version: \"Because he is not afraid, he is\\n                able to realize nirvana. Birth and death are no more, the holy life has been\\n                realized, what needs to be done has been done, there will be no more births.\" This\\n                quotation, which is not found in the first and second versions, appears three times\\n                in the third version. It is a sentence that is found over and over again in the\\n                sutras and most probably during the course of oral transmission it was added here.</p>\\n            <p>IV.</p>\\n            <p>This section deals with observing the mind in the mind. The third version does not\\n                mention mindfulness of the process of the arising and disappearing of psychological\\n                phenomena as do the first and second versions. In the third version, it is mentioned\\n                that we observe the dharmas that we can know, see, and observe as well as dharmas\\n                that we cannot observe. The word \"observe\" here has the meaning of practicing\\n                mindful observation. Observing dharmas which cannot be observed is a strange idea,\\n                equivalent to the teaching of the Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters, \"Our practice is the\\n                practice which is non-practice,\" which has a strong Mahayana flavor.</p>\\n            <p>An additional quotation of interest from the third version is: \"The practitioner does\\n                not rely on anything at all, does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because\\n                there is no arising of such thoughts, there is no more fear. Because there is no\\n                more fear, no residue of the afflictions is left, and nirvana is realized.\" The\\n                latter part of this quotation is nearly equivalent to the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya\\n                Sutra: \"Having no obstacles, they overcome fear, liberating themselves forever from\\n                illusion and realizing perfect nirvana.\"</p>\\n            <p>V.</p>\\n            <p>This part deals with the practice of observing dharmas in dharmas. In the first\\n                version, we have the practices of observing the Five Obstacles, the Five Skandhas,\\n                the Twelve Realms of Sense Organs and Sense Objects, the Seven Factors of Awakening,\\n                and the Four Noble Truths. The first version (in its form in the Digha Nikaya)\\n                develops a teaching on the mindful observation of the Four Noble Truths and the\\n                Noble Eightfold Path, and this development is what gives it its name Maha (\"great\")\\n                Satipatthana. The second version only teaches mindful observation of the Twelve\\n                Realms, the Five Obstacles, and the Seven Factors of Awakening.</p>\\n            <p>The third version only teaches the Seven Factors of Awakening. (It has already dealt\\n                with the Five Obstacles in its first section.) Possibly because of carelessness on\\n                the part of the copyist, only six of the Seven Factors of Awakening are mentioned:\\n                mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, energy, joy, concentration, and equanimity.\\n                The third version teaches the Four Jhanas. The terms vitarka and vicara, usually\\n                translated as \"initial application\" and \"sustained attention\" are translated into\\n                Chinese as jue (\"perception\") and guan (\"observation\"). In this fifth section, the\\n                third version repeats the phrases we have already seen in the second and fourth\\n                sections and which have been compared with part of the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya\\n                Sutra, and adds some words that make it seem even closer to the Prajñaparamita.\\n                These words are equivalent to \"liberating themselves forever from illusion\" of the\\n                Prajñaparamita.</p>\\n            <p>VI.</p>\\n            <p>This section deals with the length of time the practitioner needs to realize the\\n                fruits of the practice, and it identifies what those fruits are. The first version\\n                says that the fruit known as the highest understanding can be reached in this very\\n                life, if the practitioner practices the Establishments of Mindfulness. The sutra\\n                says that practicing for seven years, five years, down to one month, and half a\\n                month, and, finally, seven days, can also result in the highest understanding.</p>\\n            <p>The second version goes farther, saying that to practice mindfulness for one day and\\n                night can lead to highest awakening, or that if we begin to practice in the morning,\\n                by the afternoon the practice will already have results. The third version does not\\n                mention the period of time necessary for realizing the fruits of the practice.</p>\\n        </section> <!--\\n        section level 2 Summary -->\\n    </section> '"

Liberation and happiness are linked to each other; if there is liberation, there\\n            is happiness, and greater liberation brings greater happiness. If there is liberation,\\n            peace and joy exist in the present moment. We don\\'t need to wait ten or fifteen years to\\n            realize them. They\\'re available as soon as we begin the practice. However modest these\\n            elements may be, they form the basis for greater liberation, peace, and joy in the\\n            future.</p>\\n        <p>To practice meditation is to look deeply in order to see into the essence of things. With\\n            insight and understanding we can realize liberation, peace, and joy. Our anger, anxiety,\\n            and fear are the ropes that bind us to suffering. If we want to be liberated from them,\\n            we need to observe their nature, which is ignorance, the lack of clear understanding.\\n            When we misunderstand a friend, we may become angry at him, and because of that, we may\\n            suffer. But when we look deeply into what has happened, we can end the misunderstanding.\\n            When we understand the other person and his situation, our suffering will disappear and\\n            peace and joy will arise. The first step is awareness of the object, and the second step\\n            is looking deeply at the object to shed light on it. Therefore, mindfulness means\\n            awareness and it also means looking deeply.</p>\\n        <p>The Pali word sati (Sanskrit: smrti) means \"to stop,\" and \"to maintain awareness of the\\n            object.\" The Pali word vipassana (Sanskrit: vipashyana) means \"to go deeply into that\\n            object to observe it.\" While we are fully aware of and observing deeply an object, the\\n            boundary between the subject who observes and the object being observed gradually\\n            dissolves, and the subject and object become one. This is the essence of meditation.\\n            Only when we penetrate an object and become one with it can we understand. It is not\\n            enough to stand outside and observe an object. That\\'s why the Sutra on the Four\\n            Establishments of Mindfulness reminds us to be aware of the body in the body, the\\n            feelings in the feelings, the mind in the mind, and the objects of mind in the objects\\n            of mind.</p>\\n        <p>The Buddha delivered the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness to an audience\\n            of monks and nuns, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. But that doesn\\'t mean that the practice of\\n            being mindful in the ground of the Four Establishments is limited to monks and nuns.\\n            Anyone can practice mindfulness. If monks and nuns can practice mindfulness in walking,\\n            standing, lying down, and sitting, then laymen and laywomen also can. Is there anyone\\n            who does not walk, stand, lie down, and sit every day? What is most important is to\\n            understand the fundamental basis of the practice and then apply it during our everyday\\n            lives, even if our lives are different from the way the Buddha and his monks and nuns\\n            lived twenty-five centuries ago. When reading the Sutra on the Four Establishments of\\n            Mindfulness, we have to read with the eyes of a person of today and discover appropriate\\n            ways to practice based on the teachings of the sutra.<footnote-ref id=\"1\">1</footnote-ref></p>\\n        <p>Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. There are four areas of mindfulness, four\\n            areas where mindfulness has to penetrate in order for us to be protected, for joy to be\\n            nourished, for pain to be transformed, and for insight to be obtained. These are called\\n            the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. These four establishments, or foundations, are\\n            body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind.</p>\\n        <p>The First Establishment of Mindfulness is mindfulness of the body in the body. This means\\n            that when you bring mindfulness into your body, mindfulness becomes the body.\\n            Mindfulness is not an outside observer. Mindfulness becomes the body, and the body\\n            becomes mindfulness. When mother embraces child, mother becomes child, and child becomes\\n            mother. In true meditation, the subject and the object of meditation no longer exist as\\n            separate entities; that distinction is removed. When you generate the energy of\\n            mindfulness and embrace your breathing and your body, that is mindfulness of the body in\\n            the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer, it is the body. The body becomes the\\n            object and the subject of mindfulness at the same time.</p>\\n        <p>It\\'s like when nuclear scientists say that to understand an elementary particle and\\n            really enter into the world of the infinitely small, you have to become a participant\\n            and not an observer anymore. In India they use the example of a grain of salt that would\\n            like to know how salty the ocean is. How can a grain of salt come to know this? The only\\n            way is for it to jump into the ocean, and the understanding will be perfect; the\\n            separation between the object of understanding and the subject of understanding is no\\n            longer there. In our time, nuclear scientists have begun to see that. That is why they\\n            say that in order to really understand the world of the elementary particle, you have to\\n            stop being an observer, you have to become a participant.</p>\\n        <p>The Second Establishment of Mindfulness is our feelings. The Third Establishment of\\n            Mindfulness is the mind, namely the mental formations. In the Sutra on the Full\\n            Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha offered us four exercises of mindful breathing to\\n            take care of each of these fields of our mindfulness.</p>\\n        <p>The Fourth Establishment of Mindfulness is the realm of perception. In the sutra it is\\n            spoken of as \"the objects of mind,\" and we can understand this as perception. The Buddha\\n            also proposed four exercises on mindful breathing for contemplation of the objects of\\n            mind in the objects of mind, so that we can penetrate, embrace, and look deeply into the\\n            object of our perception. Doing so gives us the insight that will liberate us from our\\n            delusion and our suffering.</p>\\n        <p>Mountains, rivers, birds, the blue sky, houses, streams, children,\\n            animals—everything is the object of your perception. And we have four exercises of\\n            mindful breathing in order to help us inquire about the true nature of all these things,\\n            including ourselves. Body is also an object of mind, feelings are also objects of our\\n            mind, and mental formations become objects of our mind. We can always inquire about the\\n            nature of our body, our feelings, or our mind, as well as our perceptions and other\\n            things. If we look deeply at the body in the body, it becomes an object of the mind.\\n            When we are looking at feelings, then feelings are the object of mind. When we are\\n            observing mind, mind becomes the object of our mind. All the establishments of\\n            mindfulness are in fact objects of mind.</p>\\n        <p>A monk once asked me how mind can be an object of mind. I said if we take our two fingers\\n            and rub them together, then the body is in touch with the body. The mind is the same.\\n            When we look into our body, our body is the object of our mind. When we look into form,\\n            form is the object of our mind. When we look into mental formations, mental formations\\n            are the object of our mind. So we see that the field of objects of mind is very vast.\\n            But the division into four establishments is a convenient tool to help us learn how to\\n            practice mindfulness.</p>\\n        <p>If you would like to study meditation, this Sutra on the Four Establishments of\\n            Mindfulness is part of your foundation. This is one of the sutras you keep under your\\n            pillow, always with you.</p>\\n    </section>\\n    \\n\\nProvide a pure plain text output of (query, text) pairs as a Python list of tuples. \\nDo not include any Python code syntax such as python, triple backticks, or queries =. \\nOnly return the list content, with each pair in the form (query, text) as a tuple, in a clean text format.\\nFor example: [(text, text), (text, text), ...]\\n'}],\n",

These teachings have since spread throughout the world, and the foundation of\\n            these teachings remains the practice of mindful observation. The Sutra on the Four\\n            Establishments of Mindfulness has been studied, practiced, and handed down with special\\n            care from generation to generation for over 2,500 years.</p>\\n        <p>The four methods of mindfulness described in the sutra are: (1) mindfulness of the body,\\n            (2) mindfulness of the feelings, (3) mindfulness of the mind, and (4) mindfulness of the\\n            objects of mind. In the establishment known as the body, the practitioner is fully aware\\n            of the breath, the positions of the body, the actions of the body, the various parts of\\n            the body, the four elements which comprise the body, and the decomposition of the body\\n            as a corpse. In the establishment known as the feelings, the practitioner is fully aware\\n            of pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings as they arise, endure, and disappear. He is\\n            aware of feelings that have a psychological basis and feelings that have a physiological\\n            basis. In the establishment known as the mind, the practitioner is fully aware of states\\n            of mind such as desire, hatred, confusion, concentration, dispersion, internal\\n            formations, and liberation. In the establishment known as the objects of mind, the\\n            practitioner is fully aware of the Five Aggregates that comprise a person (form,\\n            feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness), the sense organs and their\\n            objects, the factors that can obstruct understanding and liberation, the factors that\\n            can lead to awakening, and the Four Noble Truths concerning suffering and the release\\n            from suffering.</p>\\n        <p>As you see, the sutra is divided into six sections: Section One describes the\\n            circumstances under which the sutra was delivered and the importance of the teachings of\\n            the sutra, and it lists the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. Section Two describes\\n            the method of mindfulness of the body in the body. Section Three describes the method of\\n            mindfulness of the feelings in the feelings. Section Four describes the method of\\n            mindfulness of the mind in the mind. Section Five describes the method of mindfulness of\\n            the objects of mind in the objects of mind.

When we breathe in, we\\n                    know that we are breathing in. When we breathe out, we know that we are\\n                    breathing out. Practicing in this way, our breathing becomes conscious\\n                    breathing. This exercise is simple, yet its effects are profound. To succeed, we\\n                    must put our whole mind into our breathing and nowhere else. As we follow our\\n                    in-breath, for example, we need to be watchful of distracting thoughts. As soon\\n                    as a thought such as, \"I forgot to turn off the light in the kitchen,\" arises,\\n                    our breathing is no longer conscious breathing as we are thinking about\\n                    something else. To succeed, our mind needs to stay focused on our breathing for\\n                    the entire length of each breath. As we breathe, our mind is one with our\\n                    breath, and we become one with our breath. That is the meaning of \"mindfulness\\n                    of the body in the body.\"</p>\\n                <p>Anyone can succeed in the practice of a single conscious breath. If we continue\\n                    to breathe consciously for ten breaths, without our mind going astray, then we\\n                    have taken a valuable step on the path of practice. If we can practice conscious\\n                    breathing for ten minutes, an important change will take place in us. How can a\\n                    practice as simple as this bring about such important results and what are the\\n                    results that it can bring about?</p>\\n                <p>The first result of conscious breathing is returning to ourselves. In everyday\\n                    life, we often get lost in forgetfulness. Our mind chases after thousands of\\n                    things, and we rarely take the time to come back to ourselves. When we have been\\n                    lost in forgetfulness like that for a long time, we lose touch with ourselves,\\n                    and we feel alienated from ourselves. This phenomenon is very common in our\\n                    times. Conscious breathing is a marvelous way to return to ourselves. When we\\n                    are aware of our breath, we come back to ourselves as quick as a flash of\\n                    lightning. Like a child who returns home after a long journey, we feel the\\n                    warmth of our hearth, and we find ourselves again. Coming back to ourselves is\\n                    already a remarkable success on the path of the practice.</p>\\n                <p>The second result of conscious breathing is that we come in contact with life in\\n                    the present moment, the only moment when we can touch life. The life in us and\\n                    around us is wonderful and abundant. If we\\'re not free, we can\\'t be in contact\\n                    with it, and we\\'re not really living our lives. We shouldn\\'t be imprisoned by\\n                    regrets about the past, anxieties for the future, or attachment and aversion in\\n                    the present.</p>\\n                <p>To breathe with full awareness is a miraculous way to untie the knots of regret\\n                    and anxiety and to be in touch with life in the present moment. When we follow\\n                    our breathing, we are already at ease, no longer dominated by our anxieties and\\n                    longings. As we breathe consciously, our breath becomes more regular, and peace\\n                    and joy arise and become more stable with every moment. Relying on our\\n                    breathing, we come back to ourselves and are able to restore the oneness of our\\n                    body and mind. This integration allows us to be in real contact with what is\\n                    happening in the present moment, which is the essence of life.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 2 | Following the Breath</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When he breathes in a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a long\\n                    breath.\\'\\n                    When he breathes out a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out a long\\n                    breath.\\' When he breathes in a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a\\n                    short breath.\\'When he breathes out a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out\\n                    a short breath.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>The practitioner follows his breathing very closely and becomes one with his\\n                    breathing for the entire length of the breath, not allowing any stray thought or\\n                    idea to enter. This method is called \"following the breath.\" While the mind is\\n                    following the breath, the mind is the breath and only the breath.

This brings\\n                    about feelings of joy, peace, and ease in the body.

The element used to\\n                    bring this about is the breath. In meditation practice, the distinction between\\n                    body and mind dissolves, and we talk of the oneness of body and mind. In this\\n                    exercise, the object of our mindfulness is no longer simply the breath, but the\\n                    whole body itself, as it is unified with the breath.</p>\\n                <p>Some practitioners and commentators, because they attach so much importance to\\n                    the realization of the states of concentration (Pali: jhana; Sanskrit: dhyana)\\n                    of the Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas, have explained the term\\n                    \"whole body\" to mean the \"whole breath body\" and not the physical body of the\\n                    practitioner. The Patisambhida Magga, Vimutti Magga, and Visuddhi Magga, all\\n                    well-known commentaries, tell us to concentrate on the tip of our nose, the\\n                    place where the air enters and goes out from the body, as we breathe. We are not\\n                    told to follow our breath into our body, because the commentators fear that our\\n                    body may be too large an object for us to concentrate on. This kind of reasoning\\n                    has led the commentators to interpret the word \"body\" (kaya) in the sutra as\\n                    \"breath body.\" But as we read the sutra, we see that the practice of being\\n                    mindful of the whole \"breath body\" was already dealt with in the second\\n                    exercise: \"Breathing in a long breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing in a long\\n                    breath.\\' Breathing out a short breath, he knows, \\'I am breathing out a short\\n                    breath.\\' \" Why then do we need to repeat this exercise?</p>\\n                <p>The first four exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing\\n                    (Anapanasati) teach us to focus our attention on the body, so it is natural for\\n                    the third exercise in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness\\n                    (Satipatthana) also to focus on the full awareness of the physical body. Nowhere\\n                    in either sutra are we taught to concentrate on the breath at the tip of the\\n                    nose. Nowhere are we taught that we shouldn\\'t concentrate on the whole physical\\n                    body.</p>\\n                <p>In recent times, the Burmese meditation master Mahasi Sayadaw taught the method\\n                    of being attentive to the inflation and contraction of the abdomen caused by the\\n                    in-breath and the out-breath. Using this method, the practitioner can realize\\n                    concentration easily, but it isn\\'t described by the Mahasi as a method of\\n                    awareness of breathing. The basic reason for doing this practice, according to\\n                    the Mahasi, is that understanding (prajña) arises naturally when there is\\n                    concentration. Perhaps the reason Mahasi Sayadaw doesn\\'t describe this method as\\n                    a practice of awareness of breathing is because of traditional prejudice that\\n                    conscious breathing should not follow the breath into the body and down into the\\n                    abdomen.</p>\\n                <p>Here it may be useful to say something about the purpose of concentration. Right\\n                    Concentration (samyak samadhi), one stage of the Noble Eightfold Path, leads to\\n                    an awareness and deep observation of the object of concentration and eventually\\n                    to awakened understanding. The Pali compound word samatha-vipassana (Sanskrit:\\n                    samatha-vipashyana) means \"stopping-observing,\" \"calming-illuminating,\" or\\n                    \"concentrating-understanding.\"</p>\\n                <p>There are also states of concentration that encourage the practitioner to escape\\n                    from the complexities of suffering and existence, rather than face them directly\\n                    in order to transform them. These can be called \"wrong concentration.\" The Four\\n                    Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas are states of meditational\\n                    concentration which the Buddha practiced with teachers such as Alara Kalama and\\n                    Uddaka Ramaputta, and he rejected them as not leading to liberation from\\n                    suffering. These states of concentration probably found their way back into the\\n                    sutras around two hundred years after the Buddha passed into mahaparinirvana .\\n                    The results of these concentrations are to hide reality from the practitioner,\\n                    so we can assume that they shouldn\\'t be considered Right Concentration. To dwell\\n                    in these concentrations for a duration of time for the sake of healing may be\\n                    one thing, but to escape in them for a long time isn\\'t what the Buddha\\n                    recommended.</p>\\n                <p>In the third exercise, the practitioner uses her breathing to bring body and mind\\n                    together as one, so the object of concentration is simultaneously body, mind,\\n                    and breath. This condition, known as \"oneness of body and mind,\" is one of total\\n                    integration. In our daily lives, we often find our mind and our body separated.\\n                    Our body may be here, while our mind is somewhere else, perhaps lost in the\\n                    distant past or floating in a distant future. Through mindfulness, we can\\n                    realize the oneness of body and mind, and we\\'re able to restore the wholeness of\\n                    ourselves. In this condition, every practice will take us back to the source,\\n                    which is the oneness of body and mind, and we open to a real encounter with\\n                    life.</p>\\n                <p>When body and mind are one, the wounds in our hearts, minds, and bodies begin to\\n                    heal. As long as there is separation between body and mind, these wounds can\\'t\\n                    heal. During sitting meditation, the three elements of breath, body, and mind\\n                    are calmed, and gradually they become one. When peace is established in one of\\n                    the three elements, the other two will soon have peace also. For example, if the\\n                    body is in a very stable position and all the muscles and the nervous system are\\n                    relaxed, then the mind and breath are immediately influenced, and they too\\n                    gradually become calmed. Similarly, if we practice conscious breathing in the\\n                    right way, our breathing becomes more regular, calm, and harmonious with every\\n                    moment, and this regularity, calmness, and harmony of the breathing will spread\\n                    to our body and mind, and the body and mind will benefit from it. It\\'s only by\\n                    these kinds of processes that the oneness of body and mind will be achieved.\\n                    When there\\'s oneness of body and mind, the breathing serves as \"harmonizer,\" and\\n                    we realize peace, joy, and ease, the first fruits of meditation practice.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 4 | Calming</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I calm my body.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise, a continuation of the third, uses the breath to realize peace and\\n                    calm in our whole body. When our body is not at peace, it\\'s hard for our mind to\\n                    be at peace. Therefore, we should use our breathing to help the functions of our\\n                    body be smooth and peaceful. If we\\'re gasping for breath or if our breath is\\n                    irregular, we can\\'t calm the functions of our body. So the first thing is to\\n                    harmonize our breathing. Our in-breaths and out-breaths should flow smoothly and\\n                    lightly. When our breath is harmonious, our body is also. Our breath needs to be\\n                    light and even and not audible. It should flow smoothly, like a small stream of\\n                    water running down fine sand into the ocean. The more subtle our breath is, the\\n                    more peaceful our body and mind will be. When we breathe in, we can feel the\\n                    breath entering our body and calming all the cells of our body. When we breathe\\n                    out, we feel the exhalation taking with it all our tiredness, irritation, and\\n                    anxiety.</p>\\n                <p>As we breathe, we can recite the following gatha to ourselves:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Breathing in, I calm my body.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out, I smile.</p>\\n                    <p>Dwelling in the present moment,</p>\\n                    <p>I know this is a wonderful moment.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>We know that when we\\'re meditating, body and mind are one, so we only need to\\n                    calm our body in order to calm our mind. When we smile, we demonstrate the peace\\n                    and joy of body and mind. Feelings of peace and joy are the nourishment of the\\n                    practitioner and help the practitioner go far on the path of practice. To learn\\n                    more about this, you are encouraged to practice the fifth and sixth exercises of\\n                    the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. These two exercises are designed\\n                    to help the practitioner nourish herself with the joy of meditational\\n                    concentration. The essence of meditation practice is to come back to dwell in\\n                    the present moment and to observe what is happening in the present moment. \"A\\n                    wonderful moment\" means that the practitioner can see the wonders of life in her\\n                    body, mind, and breathing and can make the feelings of peace and happiness\\n                    stable and strong.</p>\\n                <p>Although we are now discussing the part of the sutra that teaches full awareness\\n                    of the body in the body, since there are very close links between the body and\\n                    the feelings, we should not hesitate to cross freely the boundary between the\\n                    establishment of the body and the establishment of the feelings. As we already\\n                    know, the peace of the body is the peace of the mind.</p>\\n                <p>In exercises three and four, the practitioner follows the breath while returning\\n                    to be one with the body and calming the whole of the body. Obviously, while\\n                    practicing these breathing exercises, all your organs of sense\\n                    perception—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—are closed off so that the\\n                    images of the world around don\\'t come in and agitate the peace within. To return\\n                    to the body in this way is also to return to the mind.</p>\\n                <p>From time to time, we feel tired, and everything we do or say seems to come out\\n                    wrong and create misunderstanding. We may think, \"Today is not my day.\" At times\\n                    like this, it\\'s best simply to return to our body, cut off all contact, and\\n                    close the doors of the senses. Following our breathing, we can collect our mind,\\n                    body, and breath, and they will become one. We will have a feeling of warmth,\\n                    like someone sitting inside by a fireplace while the wind and rain are raging\\n                    outside. This method can be practiced anywhere at any time, not just in the\\n                    meditation hall. We come back in contact with ourselves and make ourselves whole\\n                    again.</p>\\n                <p>We shouldn\\'t think that to close the doors of the sense perceptions is to close\\n                    ourselves off from life and the world, to sever our contact with life. When\\n                    we\\'re not truly ourselves, when we\\'re divided and dispersed, we\\'re not really in\\n                    contact with life. The contact is profound only when we are really ourselves. If\\n                    we\\'re not ourselves in the present moment, when we look at the blue sky, we\\n                    don\\'t really see the blue sky. When we hold the hand of a child, we aren\\'t\\n                    really holding the hand of a child. When we drink tea, we\\'re not really drinking\\n                    tea. Therefore, the wholeness of ourselves is the basis of any meaningful\\n                    contact. We can realize the wholeness of ourselves by means of conscious\\n                    breathing, which brings us back to our body and mind. Realizing the wholeness of\\n                    ourselves is also to renew ourselves in every moment. We become fresh, and\\n                    others enjoy being with us. When we renew ourselves, we see everything else as\\n                    new.

Before beginning\\n                    any kind of walking meditation, we can recite the following gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>The mind can go in a thousand directions,</p>\\n                    <p>But on this beautiful path, I walk in peace.</p>\\n                    <p>With each step, a gentle wind blows.</p>\\n                    <p>With each step, a flower blooms.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>Anytime we sit down, we can follow our breath and use this gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Sitting here</p>\\n                    <p>is like sitting under the Bodhi tree.</p>\\n                    <p>My body is mindfulness itself,</p>\\n                    <p>entirely free from distraction.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>We can use our breathing in order to be aware of the positions of sitting and\\n                    standing. When we\\'re standing in a line waiting to buy a ticket, or when we\\'re\\n                    just sitting down and waiting for anything, we can recite the gatha, \"Breathing\\n                    in, I calm my body,\" in order to continue dwelling in mindfulness and to calm\\n                    our body and mind.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 6 | Bodily Actions</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Moreover, when the practitioner is going forward or backward, he\\n                    applies full\\n                    awareness to his going forward or backward. When he looks in front or looks\\n                    behind, bends down or stands up, he also applies full awareness to what he is\\n                    doing. He applies full awareness to wearing the sanghati robe or carrying the\\n                    alms bowl. When he eats or drinks, chews or savors the food, he applies full\\n                    awareness to all this. When passing excrement or urinating, he applies full\\n                    awareness to this. When he walks, stands, lies down, sits, sleeps or wakes up,\\n                    speaks or is silent, he shines his awareness on all this.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise is the observation and awareness of the actions of the body. This\\n                    is the fundamental practice of the monk. When I was first ordained as a novice\\n                    over sixty years ago, the first book my master gave me to learn by heart was a\\n                    book of short verses (gathas) to be practiced while washing your hands, brushing\\n                    your teeth, washing your face, putting on your clothes, sweeping the courtyard,\\n                    relieving yourself, having a bath, and so on. On hearing the sound of the bell,\\n                    we would breathe consciously and recite this gatha:</p>\\n                <gatha>\\n                    <p>Hearing the sound of the bell,</p>\\n                    <p>the afflictions are lifted.</p>\\n                    <p>Understanding grows strong,</p>\\n                    <p>and the awakened mind is born.</p>\\n                </gatha>\\n                <p>Practicing breathing in combination with reciting a gatha helps us dwell more\\n                    easily in mindfulness. Mindfulness makes every action of our body more serene,\\n                    and we become master of our body and mind. Mindfulness nurtures the power of\\n                    concentration in us. Many of the gathas in the book I was given, Gathas for\\n                    Everyday Use, a text by Chinese master Du Ti, were taken from the Avatamsaka\\n                    Sutra. I have written a book of gathas in the same spirit, Present Moment,\\n                    Wonderful Moment.<footnote-ref id=\"2\">2</footnote-ref> These gathas are very\\n                    easy to use and can also be combined with conscious breathing.</p>\\n                <p>Without mindfulness, our actions are often hurried and abrupt. As we practice the\\n                    sixth exercise, we may find that our actions slow down. If a novice applies\\n                    himself to the practice of the sixth exercise, he\\'ll see that his everyday\\n                    actions become harmonious, graceful, and measured. Mindfulness becomes visible\\n                    in his actions and speech. When any action is placed in the light of\\n                    mindfulness, the body and mind become relaxed, peaceful, and joyful. The sixth\\n                    exercise is one to be used day and night throughout our entire life.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 7| Parts of the Body</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, the practitioner meditates on his very own body from the soles\\n                    of the\\n                    feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body\\n                    contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the\\n                    body: \\'Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth,\\n                    skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm,\\n                    spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat,\\n                    fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise brings us into even deeper contact with our body. Here we observe\\n                    the body in all its parts, from the hair on the head to the skin on the soles of\\n                    the feet. In the process of our observation, we scan all the parts of the body,\\n                    including the brain, heart, lungs, gall bladder, spleen, blood, urine, and so\\n                    forth. The Buddha gives us the example of a farmer pouring the contents of a\\n                    sack filled with a variety of seeds onto the floor and then observing and\\n                    identifying each kind of seed: \"This is rice, these are beans, these are sesame\\n                    seeds.\"</p>\\n                <p>We use our conscious breathing in order to observe mindfully all the parts of the\\n                    body. For example: \"Breathing in, I am aware of the hair on my head. Breathing\\n                    out, I know that this is the hair on my head.\" Breathing consciously helps us\\n                    dwell in mindfulness more easily and sustain the work of observing each part of\\n                    the body. In addition to the conscious breathing, we can use the method of\\n                    silently calling each part of the body by name to enable these parts to become\\n                    increasingly clear in the light of mindfulness.</p>\\n                <p>Why do we need to observe in mindfulness the different parts of the body? First\\n                    of all, it is to be in contact with the body. We often have the impression that\\n                    we\\'re already totally in touch with our body, but often we\\'re wrong. Between us\\n                    and our body there can be a large separation, and our body remains a stranger to\\n                    us. Sometimes we hate our body. There are even people who see their body as a\\n                    prison and a place of punishment. To come back to our body is to become familiar\\n                    with it and to establish harmony with it. We know that if our body isn\\'t happy,\\n                    we\\'re not happy, and so we want our body to be calm and peaceful. To do so, we\\n                    come back to our body and make peace with it.</p>\\n                <p>We can try touching the different parts of our body to make their acquaintance.\\n                    We should touch each part in an affectionate and caring way. For several\\n                    decades, our eyes, feet, and heart have done their work devotedly and faithfully\\n                    with us and for us, but we never really give them much attention or express our\\n                    gratitude to them. It\\'s necessary to establish a close relationship with our\\n                    body.</p>\\n                <p>The second reason for mindfully observing the different parts of the body is that\\n                    each part can be the door to liberation and awakening. At first we\\'ll only\\n                    recognize the presence of the part of the body being observed, but later we\\'ll\\n                    come to see its true nature. Every hair on our head and every cell in our body\\n                    contains the entire universe. Observing the interdependent nature of a single\\n                    hair can help us to see into the nature of the universe.</p>\\n                <p>The exercise of observing every part of the body begins with the hair on the head\\n                    and goes down to the skin on the soles of the feet. Sometimes we observe just\\n                    one part of the body deeply, such as our eyes, heart, or toe. In the process of\\n                    observation from the head to the feet, some observations may spring up in our\\n                    mind. For example, as we pass our heart, we may think, \"My friend John has a\\n                    heart condition. I must visit him soon to see if he\\'s all right.\" We can note\\n                    these observations and then continue with the work of observing the remaining\\n                    parts of the body. Later we can return to those observations.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 8 | Body and Universe</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, in whichever position his body happens to be, the practitioner\\n                    passes in\\n                    review the elements which constitute the body: \\'In this body is the earth\\n                    element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise shows us the interrelationship of our body and all that is in the\\n                    universe. It\\'s one of the principal ways of witnessing for ourselves the\\n                    nonself, unborn, and never-dying nature of all that is. Seeing things in this\\n                    way can liberate and awaken us.</p>\\n                <p>The sutra teaches us that we should be aware of the presence of earth, water,\\n                    fire, and air elements in our body. These are the Four Great Elements (Sanskrit:\\n                    mahabhuta), also referred to as the realms (Sanskrit: dhatu). The earth element\\n                    represents the hard, solid nature of matter. The water element represents the\\n                    liquid, permeating nature. The fire element represents heat, and the air element\\n                    represents movement. The Dhatuvibhanga Sutra and the second version of the sutra\\n                    on mindfulness in this book both refer to six elements—the two additional\\n                    elements are space (Sanskrit: akasa) and consciousness (Sanskrit: vijñana).</p>\\n                <p>Our bodies are more than three-fourths water. When the practitioner looks deeply\\n                    in order to see the water in his body, not only does he see the liquid,\\n                    permeating nature of the blood, sweat, saliva, tears, and urine, but he also\\n                    sees the water element in every cell of his body. There are clouds in the body,\\n                    because without clouds there can be no rain, and we won\\'t have any water to\\n                    drink or grains and vegetables to eat. We see earth in us, earth as the minerals\\n                    in our body. We also see that earth is alive in us because, thanks to Mother\\n                    Earth, we have food to eat. We see air in us, air representing movement. Without\\n                    air we could not survive, since we, as every other species on Earth, need air to\\n                    live.</p>\\n                <p>The practitioner observes her body mindfully to see all that is in it and to see\\n                    the interrelated nature of herself and the universe. She sees that his life is\\n                    not just present in her own body, and she transcends the erroneous view that\\n                    she\\'s just her body. In the book The Sun My Heart, I refer to the sun as our\\n                    second heart, a heart which lies outside our body but which is as essential for\\n                    our body as the heart inside our body.<footnote-ref id=\"3\">3</footnote-ref> When\\n                    the heart inside the body ceases to function, we know very well that we will\\n                    die, but we often forget that if the heart outside our body, the sun, ceases to\\n                    function, we will also die immediately. When we observe mindfully the\\n                    interdependent nature of our body, we see our life outside our body, and we\\n                    transcend the boundary between self and nonself. This practice of mindful\\n                    observation helps us go beyond such limiting concepts as birth and death.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 9 | Body As Impermanent</title>\\n                <section level=\"4\" type=\"canonical-list\">\\n                    <title>The Nine Contemplations (the nine stages of decomposition of a corpse):</title>\\n                    <list>\\n                        <item>1.

When we first read this, we may feel that this is not a pleasant\\n                    meditation. But the effect of this practice can be very great. It can be\\n                    liberating and can bring us much peace and joy. The practitioner observes\\n                    mindfully in order to see the corpse at each of these stages and to see that it\\n                    is inevitable that her own body will pass through the same stages.</p>\\n                <p>In former times, practitioners would actually sit in cemeteries and observe\\n                    corpses in these various stages of decomposition. Of course, today, decomposing\\n                    bodies aren\\'t exposed for us to view. But we can visualize them according to the\\n                    description in the sutra. This exercise should be practiced by those who are in\\n                    good mental and physical health. It shouldn\\'t be practiced by those who have not\\n                    yet mastered desire and aversion. Its intention is not to make us weary of life,\\n                    but to help us see how precious life is; not to make us pessimistic, but to help\\n                    us see the impermanent nature of life so that we don\\'t waste our lives. If we\\n                    have the courage to see things as they are, our meditation will have beneficial\\n                    results. When we see the impermanent nature of things, we appreciate their true\\n                    value.</p>\\n                <p>Have you ever stayed up at night to see a Cereus cactus flower open? The flower\\n                    opens and dies in a few hours, but because we\\'re aware of that, we appreciate\\n                    its wondrous fragrance and beauty. We can be in real contact with the flower and\\n                    not be sad or depressed when it fades, because we knew before it opened how\\n                    ephemeral its life was.</p>\\n                <p>Our dear ones who live with us and the beautiful and precious beings around us\\n                    are all wonderful cactus flowers.

If we know how to value them, we\\'ll have the time to be in real contact\\n                    with them, and we\\'ll take care of them, make them happy, and therefore be\\n                    happier ourselves.</p>\\n                <p>These Nine Contemplations help us see the preciousness of life.

He remains established in the\\n                    observation of the process of coming-to-be in the body or the process of\\n                    dissolution in the body or both the process of coming-to-be and the process of\\n                    dissolution. Or he is mindful of the fact, \\'There is a body here,\\' until\\n                    understanding and full awareness come about. He remains established in the\\n                    observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration.</p>\\n                <p>We should remember that the breathing, the positions of the body, the movements\\n                    of the body, and the parts of the body all belong to the body and are the body.\\n                    To be in touch with these aspects and to be able to see the process of birth and\\n                    death and the nonself and interdependent nature of the body is the meaning of\\n                    mindful observation of the body.</p>\\n                <p>Therefore, the teachings of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependent\\n                    origination—the three basic observations of Buddhism—are realized\\n                    directly through the practice of the nine exercises for mindfully observing the\\n                    body. These nine exercises can liberate and awaken us to the way things are.</p>\\n                <p>In the second version of the sutra, the description of each body meditation\\n                    exercise is as follows:</p>\\n                <p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both within and without,\\n                    and establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity,\\n                    and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\\n                <p>The words recognition, insight, clarity, and realization here mean that the\\n                    practitioner recognizes, sees, sheds light on, and realizes the impermanent and\\n                    interdependent nature of the body and all that is, by means of the mindful\\n                    observation of the body.</p>\\n                <p>Observing the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of all that is\\n                    doesn\\'t lead us to feel aversion for life. On the contrary, it helps us see the\\n                    preciousness of all that lives. Liberation doesn\\'t mean running away from or\\n                    destroying life. Many people present Buddhism as a path that denies life, that\\n                    transcends the world of the Five Aggregates (Sanskrit: skandha) of form,\\n                    feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. To present Buddhism\\n                    in this way is no different from saying that the object of our practice is to\\n                    arrive at the absence of life or nothingness.</p>\\n                <p>In the Dhammacakka Sutta, the first Dharma talk given by the Buddha in the Deer\\n                    Park, the Buddha taught that to be attached to existence (Sanskrit: bhava) is no\\n                    worse than to be attached to nonexistence (Sanskrit: abhava). In the Kaccayana\\n                    Gotta Sutta, the Buddha also taught that reality is not to be found in terms of\\n                    existence or nonexistence. His meaning is perfectly clear: suffering is not\\n                    brought about by life, the Five Skandhas, or the selfless and interdependent\\n                    nature of all that is. The cause of ill-being is our ignorance. Because we\\'re\\n                    not able to see that the true nature of life is impermanence, selflessness, and\\n                    interdependence, we become attached to things, believing that they\\'re permanent.\\n                    From this thinking arise the roots of affliction and the internal formations or\\n                    knots: craving, hatred, pride, doubt, and so forth. Impermanence, selflessness,\\n                    and interdependence are the essential conditions for life. Without impermanence,\\n                    how can the corn seed become a corn plant and how can the baby grow up and go to\\n                    school?</p>\\n                <p>In fact, it\\'s because of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence that\\n                    things come into existence, mature, decay, and cease to be. Birth, decay, and\\n                    ceasing to be are the necessary steps of the lives of all species. Presenting\\n                    impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence as problematic, we senselessly\\n                    make life unacceptable. We need to do the opposite; we need to praise them as\\n                    essential elements of life. Only when we\\'re not able to recognize these\\n                    attributes as they are do we get caught in the knots of attachment and sorrow.</p>\\n                <p>The Ratnakuta Sutra gives the example of someone who throws a clod of earth at a\\n                    dog. When the clod hits the dog, he runs after it and barks furiously at it. The\\n                    dog doesn\\'t know that the thing responsible for his pain isn\\'t the clod of earth\\n                    but the man who threw it. The sutra teaches:</p>\\n                <p>In the same way, the ordinary man caught in dualistic conceptions is accustomed\\n                    to thinking that the Five Aggregates are the root of his suffering, but in fact\\n                    the root of suffering is the lack of understanding about the impermanent,\\n                    selfless, and interdependent nature of the Five Aggregates.</p>\\n                <p>Because we don\\'t understand correctly, we become attached to things, and then\\n                    we\\'re caught by them. In the sutra, the term \"aggregate\" (Pali: khanda;\\n                    Sanskrit: skandha) and the term \"aggregate of clinging\" (Pali: upadanakkhanda;\\n                    Sanskrit: upadanaskandha) are used. Skandhas are the five elements that give\\n                    rise to life, and the upadana skandhas are the five elements as objects of\\n                    attachment. The root of suffering isn\\'t the skandhas but the attachment that\\n                    binds us. There are people who, because of their incorrect understanding of what\\n                    the root of suffering is, instead of dealing with their attitude of attachment,\\n                    think they have to deal with their organs of sense and the aggregates, and so\\n                    they fear form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and objects of mind and feel\\n                    aversion for the body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and\\n                    consciousness.</p>\\n                <p>The Buddha was someone who, because he wasn\\'t attached to things, lived in peace,\\n                    joy, and freedom with a healthy and fresh vigor. He always had a smile on his\\n                    lips, and his presence created a fresh atmosphere around him. There are many\\n                    stories in the sutras which show how much the Buddha loved life and knew how to\\n                    appreciate the beautiful things around him. On many occasions, he pointed out\\n                    beautiful scenery to Ananda, such as the sun setting on Vulture Peak, the golden\\n                    rice fields surrounded by green paths, the fresh green landscape of the Bamboo\\n                    Forest Monastery, and the lovely town of Vaisali. The Buddha was not afraid of\\n                    beautiful things, because he was able to see the impermanent nature of\\n                    everything, beautiful or ugly. He didn\\'t chase after things, and he didn\\'t run\\n                    away from them either. The way of freedom isn\\'t running away from the Five\\n                    Aggregates, but coming face to face with them in order to understand their true\\n                    nature.</p>\\n                <p>If we cut flowers from our garden to place on the altar, that is because we\\n                    acknowledge the beauty of those flowers. All we can say is, \"Although these\\n                    flowers are beautiful, their beauty is fragile. When, in a few days time, these\\n                    flowers die, their beauty will die with them.\" We understand this, and when the\\n                    flowers wilt in a few days, we won\\'t suffer or feel sad. Because we can see the\\n                    impermanent nature of the flowers, we can appreciate all the more the beauty of\\n                    each flower. To observe the impermanence of things is not to reject them, but to\\n                    be in contact with them with deep understanding, without being caught in desire\\n                    and attachment.</p>\\n                <p>Freedom in Buddhism is the freedom which comes about by being awake and\\n                    understanding. A practitioner doesn\\'t need to struggle with desire. The two\\n                    basic meditation sutras, the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and\\n                    the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, both shed light on this principle:\\n                    \"When his mind is desiring something, the practitioner is aware, \\'My mind is\\n                    desiring\\'\" (Satipatthana Sutta), and \"Breathing in, I am aware of the functions\\n                    of my mind\" (Anapanasati Sutta). In identifying the mind of desire, in observing\\n                    the nature of that mind and the nature of the object of desire, we\\'ll see the\\n                    impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence of it, and we\\'ll no longer be\\n                    dominated by that state of mind.</p>\\n                <p>For many generations, some Buddhists have presented Buddhism as a path that\\n                    destroys desire, and they have described liberated persons as emaciated arhats\\n                    with wrinkled skin and no vitality. We should define what is meant by desire. If\\n                    we\\'ve had nothing to eat for three days, we feel like eating. Is that desire? Is\\n                    the natural desire for the indispensable elements of life a desire we need to\\n                    destroy? To eat when hungry, to drink when thirsty, is that to go against the\\n                    path which leads to emancipation? But if so, then Buddhism would be a path that\\n                    flees from and destroys life.</p>\\n                <p>We know very well that to eat and drink enough are necessary to nourish our body\\n                    and keep us strong. We also know that eating and drinking excessively can\\n                    destroy our bodies. So we can say that to eat and drink so that the body is\\n                    strong and healthy is to walk on the path of emancipation, while to eat and\\n                    drink in a way that causes our body and others to suffer is to go against the\\n                    way of liberation. In the first case desire isn\\'t present, in the second case\\n                    desire is present.</p>\\n                <p>Other Buddhists have opposed the image of the emaciated arhat destroying desire\\n                    and have described liberated persons as fresh, healthy bodhisattvas, beautiful\\n                    to look at and full of vigor. The image of the bodhisattva is very close to the\\n                    image of the Buddha entering life with a heart of love and compassion and a\\n                    smile on his lips. Although the Buddha enjoyed the solitary life, he never\\n                    refused to go deeply into the world in order to help living beings.</p>\\n                <p>To know how to appreciate a beautiful sunset is not desire, if we \"remain\\n                    established in the observation, free and not caught up in any worldly\\n                    consideration\" (Satipatthana Sutta). If we are able to see impermanence,\\n                    selflessness, and interdependence, we are awake. To swim in a cool stream, to\\n                    drink a glass of clear water, to eat a sweet orange, and to know how to\\n                    appreciate the coolness, the clarity, and the sweetness, is not desire if we are\\n                    not attached to these things. In the Southern tradition of Buddhism, and to some\\n                    extent in the Northern tradition, generations of Buddhists have expressed fear\\n                    of peace and joy and have not dared to practice peace and joy. The tenth\\n                    exercise is taken from the second version of the sutra (see Appendix). It is a\\n                    practice of peace and joy.</p>\\n            </section> <!-- section level 2 remarks\\n            on first nine exercises -->\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 10 | Healing with Joy</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body as body, when,\\n                    thanks to\\n                    having put aside the Five Desires, a feeling of bliss arises during his\\n                    concentration and saturates every part of his body.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of body as body, feels the joy\\n                    which arises during concentration saturate every part of his body.

Please read the following excerpt from\\n                    the second version:</p>\\n                <p>Like the bath attendant, who, after putting powdered soap into a basin, mixes it\\n                    with water until the soap paste has water in every part of it, so the\\n                    practitioner feels the bliss that is born when the desires of the sense realms\\n                    are put aside, saturate every part of his body.</p>\\n                <p>The feeling of joy that\\'s born when the practitioner lets go of his life of\\n                    agitation, desire, and hatred will strengthen and penetrate more deeply when he\\n                    has mastered the way of applying his mind:</p>\\n                <p>Like a spring within a mountain whose clear, pure water flows out and down all\\n                    sides of that mountain and bubbles up in places where water has not previously\\n                    entered, saturating the entire mountain, in the same way joy, born during\\n                    concentration, permeates the whole of the practitioner\\'s body; it is present\\n                    everywhere.</p>\\n                <p>When the state of happiness is really present, the joy of the mind settles down\\n                    to allow happiness to become steadier and deeper. For as long as the joy is\\n                    still there, there goes with it, to a greater or lesser extent,\\n                    conceptualization and excitement. \"Joy\" is a translation of the Sanskrit word\\n                    piti, and \"happiness\" is a translation of sukha. The following example is often\\n                    used to compare joy with happiness: Someone traveling in the desert who sees a\\n                    stream of cool water experiences joy. When he drinks the water, he experiences\\n                    happiness.</p>\\n                <p>Just as the different species of blue, pink, red, and white lotus, which grow up\\n                    from the bottom of a pond of clear water and appear on the surface of that pond,\\n                    have their tap roots, subsidiary roots, leaves, and flowers all full of the\\n                    water of that pond, and there is no part of the plant which does not contain the\\n                    water, so the feeling of happiness which arises with the disappearance of joy\\n                    permeates the whole of the practitioner\\'s body, and there is no part which it\\n                    does not penetrate.</p>\\n                <p>At the time of the meditation, the practitioner feels happy and at peace. He lets\\n                    his consciousness of this peace and happiness embrace his whole body, so that\\n                    his body is saturated by it:</p>\\n                <p>Just as someone who puts on a very long robe which reaches from his head to his\\n                    feet, and there is no part of his body which is not covered by this robe, so the\\n                    practitioner with a clear, calm mind envelops his whole body in understanding\\n                    and leaves no part of the body uncovered. This is how the practitioner is aware\\n                    of the body as the body, both within and without, and establishes mindfulness in\\n                    the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called\\n                    being aware of the body as the body.</p>\\n                <p>As we\\'ve already seen, the function of this exercise is to nourish us with joy\\n                    and happiness and to heal the wounds within us. But we have no doubts about\\n                    letting go of this joy in order to embark on the work of observation. Joy and\\n                    happiness come about because of physical and psychological conditions and are as\\n                    impermanent as all other physical and psychological phenomena. Only when, thanks\\n                    to mindful observation, we realize the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent\\n                    nature of all that is, can we achieve freedom and liberation.</p>\\n            </section> <!--\\n            section level 3 exercise -->\\n        </section> <!--\\n        section level 2 exercise group for body -->\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"exercise_group\">\\n            <title>EXERCISES FOR OBSERVING THE FEELINGS</title>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 11| Identifying Feelings</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>Whenever the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, he is aware, \\'I am\\n                    experiencing\\n                    a pleasant feeling.\\' Whenever he has a painful feeling, he is aware, \\'I am\\n                    experiencing a painful feeling.\\'Whenever he experiences a feeling which is\\n                    neither pleasant nor painful, he is aware, \\'I am experiencing a neutral\\n                    feeling.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>There are three sorts of feelings: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. The\\n                    teaching of this exercise is to identify and be in touch with these feelings as\\n                    they arise, endure, and fade away.</p>\\n                <p>When there is an unpleasant feeling, the practitioner is not in a hurry to chase\\n                    it away. She comes back to her conscious breathing and observes, \"Breathing in,\\n                    I know that an unpleasant feeling has arisen within me. Breathing out, I know\\n                    that this unpleasant feeling is present in me.\" Whenever there is a pleasant or\\n                    a neutral feeling, she practices mindful observation in accordance with that\\n                    feeling. She knows that her feeling is her, and that for the moment she is that\\n                    feeling. She is neither drowned in nor terrorized by that feeling, nor does she\\n                    reject it. This is the most effective way to be in contact with feelings. If we\\n                    call a pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feeling by its name, we identify it\\n                    clearly and recognize it more deeply. Our attitude of not clinging to or\\n                    rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go (Pali: upekkha, Sanskrit:\\n                    upeksa) and is an important part of meditation practice. Letting go is one of\\n                    the Four Unlimited Minds (Sanskrit: brahmavihara), which are love, compassion,\\n                    joy, and letting go.</p>\\n                <p>A person is comprised of the Five Aggregates—form (the body), feelings,\\n                    perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Each aggregate is a river.\\n                    Our body is a river in which every cell is a drop of water, and all of them are\\n                    in constant transformation and movement. There is also a river of feelings in\\n                    us, in which every feeling is a drop of water. Each of these\\n                    feelings—pleasant, unpleasant, neutral—relies on all other feelings\\n                    to be born, mature, and disappear. To observe the feelings is to sit on the bank\\n                    of the river of feelings and identify each feeling as it is arises, matures, and\\n                    disappears.</p>\\n                <p>Our feelings usually play an important part in directing our thoughts and our\\n                    mind. Our thoughts arise and become linked to each other around the feelings\\n                    that are present. When we are mindful of our feeling, the situation begins to\\n                    change. The feeling is no longer the only thing present in us, and it is\\n                    transformed under the light of our awareness. Therefore, it no longer sweeps us\\n                    along the way it did before there was mindfulness of the feeling. If we continue\\n                    to observe the feeling mindfully, we will be able to see its substance and its\\n                    roots. This empowers the observer. When we are able to see the nature of\\n                    something, we are able to transcend it and not be led astray or corrupted by it\\n                    anymore.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 12| Seeing the Roots of Feelings and Identifying Neutral Feelings</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When he experiences a pleasant feeling based in the body, he is aware,\\n                    \\'I am\\n                    experiencing a pleasant feeling based in the body.\\' When he experiences a\\n                    pleasant feeling based in the mind, he is aware, \\'I am experiencing a pleasant\\n                    feeling based in the mind.\\' When he experiences a painful feeling based in the\\n                    body, he is aware, \\'I am experiencing a painful feeling based in the body.\\' When\\n                    he experiences a painful feeling based in the mind, he is aware, \\'I am\\n                    experiencing a painful feeling based in the mind.\\' When he experiences a neutral\\n                    feeling based in the body, he is aware, \\'I am experiencing a neutral feeling\\n                    based in the body.\\' When he experiences a neutral feeling based in the mind, he\\n                    is aware, \\'I am experiencing a neutral feeling based in the mind.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 11 and has the capacity to help us\\n                    see the roots and the substance of the feelings we have. Our\\n                    feelings—pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral—can have a physical,\\n                    physiological, or psychological root. When we mindfully observe our feelings, we\\n                    discover their roots. For example, if you have an unpleasant feeling because you\\n                    stayed up late the night before, your unpleasant feeling has a physiological\\n                    root. Nevertheless, to be able to identify the roots of your feelings is not\\n                    enough. We have to look more deeply in order to see how these feelings manifest\\n                    and to understand their true substance. To know a feeling is not just to see its\\n                    roots but also to see its flowering and its fruits.</p>\\n                <p>When some people take a sip of whiskey or inhale from a cigarette, for example,\\n                    they may have a pleasant feeling. If they observe this feeling mindfully, they\\n                    can see its physiological and psychological roots. We know that not everyone\\n                    shares the same pleasant feeling when they drink whiskey or smoke cigarettes. If\\n                    some other people were to do either of these two things, they may cough or\\n                    choke, and the feeling would be unpleasant. Thus the roots of that feeling are\\n                    not as simple as they might appear at first. The elements of habit, time, and\\n                    our own psychology and physiology are all present in the roots of any feeling.\\n                    Looking into our feeling, we can see physiological, physical, and psychological\\n                    habits; not only our own habits, but also those of the society whose products we\\n                    are consuming.</p>\\n                <p>Looking into our feeling, we see the nature of whiskey and the nature of tobacco.\\n                    Looking into the glass of whiskey, we can see the grains that are needed for its\\n                    production. We can see the effect that the alcohol will have on our body now and\\n                    in the near future. We can see the connection between the consumption of alcohol\\n                    and car accidents. We can see the link between the consumption of alcohol and\\n                    the severe lack of food in the world. We have squandered a large amount of\\n                    grains in producing alcohol and meat, while in many places in the world,\\n                    children and adults are dying for want of grain to eat. An economist at the\\n                    University of Paris once said: \"If the western world were to consume fifty\\n                    percent less alcohol and meat, the problem of starvation in the world could be\\n                    solved.\" If we look into any one thing with the eyes of mindful observation, we\\n                    can see the roots and the results of it. If we mindfully observe a feeling, we\\n                    can see the roots of that feeling and the results it is likely to produce. The\\n                    mindful observation of a feeling can lead to a deep insight into the nature of\\n                    life.</p>\\n                <p>When we hear someone praise us, we may have a pleasant feeling. That pleasant\\n                    feeling also needs to be examined. Obviously we have the right to accept a\\n                    pleasant feeling, but we know that in our meditation practice we need to observe\\n                    mindfully in order to have clear insight into the nature of our feeling. If in\\n                    our mindful observation, we see that those words of praise were based in\\n                    flattery rather than reality, then we discover that our pleasant feeling arose\\n                    out of ignorance and self-love. Such a pleasant feeling can take us farther\\n                    along the path of illusion. When we see that, the pleasant feeling disappears,\\n                    and we come back to the ground of reality with both feet planted firmly. The\\n                    danger of being deluded no longer exists, and we become healthy again. The\\n                    pleasant feeling we have when we drink alcohol will also disappear when we see\\n                    its roots and its effects. When pleasant feelings like this disappear, they can\\n                    give rise to pleasant feelings of another kind, such as the awareness that we\\n                    are now living in a way that leads to health and awakened understanding.\\n                    Pleasant feelings of the second kind are healthy because they nourish us and\\n                    others and cause no harm.</p>\\n                <p>Even though we feel that the words of praise are in harmony with the truth, we\\n                    should continue to observe the pleasant feeling brought about by those words of\\n                    praise. The work of mindful observation helps us avoid pride or\\n                    arrogance—the two things which above all obstruct our progress on the\\n                    path. We see that if we keep on with what we have started, we will make\\n                    additional progress, and the words of praise, instead of making us proud or\\n                    arrogant, become elements of encouragement for us. If we observe mindfully like\\n                    that, the pleasant feeling on hearing words of praise becomes a healthy feeling\\n                    and has a nourishing effect.</p>\\n                <p>When we observe our feelings, we can see their relative nature. It is our way of\\n                    seeing the world that determines the nature of our feelings. One person while\\n                    working might feel that work is nothing but agony, and he will only feel happy\\n                    when he is not working. There are other people, however, who feel uneasy when\\n                    they have nothing to do and would be happy with any work rather than doing\\n                    nothing. In the latter case, work brings joy, a pleasant feeling, while in the\\n                    former case, work gives rise to unpleasant feelings, such as boredom or\\n                    drudgery. Often we do not see that we have all the conditions necessary for\\n                    happiness, and we go looking for happiness in another place or in the future. To\\n                    be able to breathe can be a great source of real happiness, but often, unless we\\n                    have a congested nose or asthma, we are not able to realize that. To be able to\\n                    see beautiful colors and forms is happiness, but often only after we have lost\\n                    our sight do we become aware of this. Having sound and healthy limbs to be able\\n                    to run and jump, living in an atmosphere of freedom, not being separated from\\n                    our family—all these things and thousands more can be elements of\\n                    happiness. But we rarely remember, and happiness slips from our grasp as we\\n                    chase other things which we believe to be necessary for our happiness.\\n                    Generally, only after we lose an element of happiness do we appreciate it.\\n                    Awareness of these precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of\\n                    Right Mindfulness. We can use conscious breathing to shine light on their\\n                    presence:</p>\\n                <meditation-verse>\\n                    <p>Breathing in,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that I have two good eyes.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that I have two able hands.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing in,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that I am holding my child in my arms.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that I am sitting with my family at the table.</p>\\n                </meditation-verse>\\n                <p>Exercises such as these nourish Right Mindfulness and bring much happiness into\\n                    our daily lives.</p>\\n                <p>Peace, joy, and happiness are above all the awareness that we have the conditions\\n                    for happiness. Thus mindfulness is the basic and essential ingredient for\\n                    happiness. If you do not know that you are happy, it means that you are not\\n                    happy. Most of us only remember that not having a toothache is happiness at the\\n                    time when we have a toothache. We are not aware of the joy of our non-toothache,\\n                    because we do not practice mindfulness.</p>\\n                <p>When a feeling is born in us, we know that it is born. As long as that feeling\\n                    continues to be present, we know that it continues to be present. We look into\\n                    it mindfully in order to be able to recognize its nature—pleasant,\\n                    unpleasant, or neutral; its roots—physical, physiological, or\\n                    psychological; and its fruits—physiological, psychological, or social. We\\n                    can use conscious breathing to assist us in carrying out this work of mindful\\n                    observation:</p>\\n                <meditation-verse>\\n                    <p>Breathing in,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that a pleasant feeling has just arisen in me.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that this pleasant feeling is still there.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing in,</p>\\n                    <p>I know that this feeling has a psychological basis.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out,</p>\\n                    <p>I can see the roots of this pleasant feeling.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing in,</p>\\n                    <p>I can see the influence of this feeling on my health.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out,</p>\\n                    <p>I can see the influence of this feeling on my mind.</p>\\n                </meditation-verse>\\n                <p>And so on.</p>\\n                <p>When roots of affliction such as anger, confusion, jealousy, and anxiety manifest\\n                    in us, our body and mind are generally disturbed by them. These psychological\\n                    feelings are unpleasant, and they agitate the functioning of our body and mind.\\n                    We lose our peace, joy, and calm. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of\\n                    Breathing, the Buddha teaches us to take hold of our breathing in order to\\n                    produce awareness of the unpleasant feeling and gradually to master it:\\n                    \"Breathing in, I know that I have an unpleasant feeling. Breathing out, I am\\n                    clearly aware of this unpleasant feeling.\" If our breathing is light and calm (a\\n                    natural result of practice), then our mind and body will slowly become light,\\n                    calm, and clear again: \"Breathing in, I calm the feelings in me. Breathing out,\\n                    I calm the feelings in me.\" In this way, the practitioner continues to use\\n                    conscious breathing to mindfully observe and calm his feelings. Every time she\\n                    sees the substance, roots, and effects of her feelings, she is no longer under\\n                    the control of those feelings. The whole character of our feelings can change\\n                    just by the presence of mindful observation.</p>\\n                <p>Fear and anger are fields of energy that arise from a physiological or\\n                    psychological base. The unpleasant feelings that arise within us are also fields\\n                    of energy. The Buddha teaches us not to repress fear or anger, or the unpleasant\\n                    feelings brought about by them, but to use our breathing to be in contact with\\n                    and accept these feelings, knowing that they are energies that originate in our\\n                    psychological or physiological make-up. To repress our feelings is to repress\\n                    ourselves. Mindful observation is based on the principle of nonduality. Our\\n                    unpleasant feelings and ourselves are one. We have to be in contact with and\\n                    accept the unpleasant feelings before we can transform them into the kinds of\\n                    energy that are healthy and have the capacity to nourish us. We have to face our\\n                    unpleasant feelings with care, affection, and nonviolence. Our unpleasant\\n                    feelings can illuminate so much for us. By our work of mindful observation, we\\n                    see that experiencing certain unpleasant feelings allows us insight and\\n                    understanding.</p>\\n                <p>Both in the sutras and the sastras (the commentaries on the sutras), the\\n                    ancestral teachers say the painful, unpleasant feelings are easier to recognize\\n                    than the neutral feelings. But in fact, neutral feelings are also easy to\\n                    recognize. They are not suffering feelings and they are not happy feelings. In\\n                    us there is a river of feelings, and every drop of water in that river is either\\n                    a suffering feeling, a happy feeling, or a neutral feeling. Sometimes we have a\\n                    neutral feeling and we think we don\\'t have a feeling at all. But a neutral\\n                    feeling is a feeling; it doesn\\'t mean the nonexistence of feeling.</p>\\n                <p>When we have a toothache, we have a feeling of pain, and when the toothache is no\\n                    longer there, we think we don\\'t have a feeling anymore. But in fact, we have a\\n                    neutral feeling. It\\'s not a painful feeling, so it must be either neutral or\\n                    pleasant. Actually, it can be a pleasant feeling. When we have a very bad\\n                    toothache, we just wish it would stop. We know if it were to stop, we would have\\n                    a very pleasant feeling. Therefore, a non-toothache is a pleasant feeling. But\\n                    once the toothache has been gone for some time, we no longer appreciate our\\n                    non-toothache. We could call it a neutral feeling, but with awareness it can\\n                    become a pleasant feeling. In Plum Village, we usually say someone who practices\\n                    mindfulness can change all neutral feelings into pleasant feelings. In fact,\\n                    neutral feelings are the majority of our feelings.</p>\\n                <p>For example, a father and son are sitting on the lawn in springtime. The father\\n                    is practicing mindful breathing and he sees how wonderful it is to sit on the\\n                    grass, feeling fresh and happy, with the yellow flowers coming up and the birds\\n                    singing; so he has pleasant feelings. But the child is bored, he doesn\\'t want to\\n                    sit with his father. He\\'s in exactly the same environment as his father. To\\n                    begin with his feeling is neutral, and at some point the neutral feeling becomes\\n                    an unpleasant feeling, because he doesn\\'t know how to deal with this neutral\\n                    feeling. So, wanting to run away from his unpleasant feeling, he stands up and\\n                    goes into the house and turns on the television. But his father is feeling very\\n                    content sitting in that same environment that was not able to bring happiness to\\n                    the son.</p>\\n                <p>We\\'re the same. When we don\\'t have a pleasant or unpleasant feeling, naturally we\\n                    have a neutral feeling. If we don\\'t know how to deal with or manage our neutral\\n                    feeling, it will turn into an unpleasant feeling. However, if we know how to\\n                    manage it, it will become a pleasant feeling, a feeling of well-being. Every\\n                    neutral feeling, when held in mindfulness, will become a pleasant feeling.</p>\\n            </section>\\n        </section> <!--\\n        section level 2 exercise group for the feelings -->\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"exercise_group\">\\n            <title>EXERCISES FOR OBSERVING THE MIND</title>\\n            <p>The Third Establishment of Mindfulness presented in the sutra is the establishment of\\n                the mind. The contents of the mind are the psychological phenomena called mental\\n                formations (cittasamskara). Feelings are also mental formations, but they were dealt\\n                with on their own in the Second Establishment of Mindfulness, because the sphere of\\n                feelings is so wide. What remains are all the other psychological phenomena, such as\\n                perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. These are all mind functions and\\n                are the objects of our mindful observation of the mind in the mind. Formations can\\n                be either mental, physical, or physiological.</p>\\n            <p>Different schools of Buddhism list different numbers of mental formations. The\\n                Abhidharmakosa School lists forty-six, the Satyasiddhi School lists forty-nine, and\\n                the Dharmalaksana School lists fifty-one. The Sutra on the Four Establishments of\\n                Mindfulness lists only twenty-eight mental formations, including desire, anger,\\n                ignorance, disturbance, narrowness, limitedness, lack of concentration, lack of\\n                freedom, dullness and drowsiness, agitation and remorse, doubt; their opposites:\\n                not-desiring, not-hating, non-ignorance, non-disturbance, tolerance, unlimitedness,\\n                concentration, freedom, absence of doubt, absence of dullness and drowsiness,\\n                absence of agitation; as well as mindfulness, distaste, peace, joy, ease, and\\n                letting go. The second version of the sutra lists one additional mental formation,\\n                impurity, which could include other mental formations that are considered to be\\n                defilements. The third version considers sensual craving as a formation separate\\n                from desire. Any of these mental formations can be the object of our mindful\\n                observation of the mind in the mind.</p>\\n            <p>The exercise of observing the mind in the mind isn\\'t different from observing the\\n                body in the body or observing the feelings in the feelings. We mindfully observe the\\n                arising, presence, and disappearance of the mental phenomena which are called mental\\n                formations. We recognize them and look deeply into them in order to see their\\n                substance, their roots in the past, and their possible fruits in the future, using\\n                conscious breathing while we observe. We should remember that when the lamp of\\n                mindfulness is lit up, the mental formation under observation will naturally\\n                transform in a wholesome direction.</p>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 13 | Observing the Desiring Mind</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When his mind is desiring, the practitioner is aware, \\'My mind is\\n                    desiring.\\' When\\n                    his mind is not desiring, he is aware, \\'My mind is not desiring.\\' When his mind\\n                    is hating something, he is aware, \\'My mind is hating.\\'When his mind is not\\n                    hating, he is aware, \\'My mind is not hating.\\' When his mind is in a state of\\n                    ignorance, he is aware, \\'My mind is in a state of ignorance.\\' When his mind is\\n                    not in a state of ignorance, he is aware, \\'My mind is not in a state of\\n                    ignorance.\\' When his mind is tense, he is aware, \\'My mind is tense.\\' When his\\n                    mind is not tense, he is aware, \\'My mind is not tense.\\' When his mind is\\n                    distracted, he is aware, \\'My mind is distracted.\\' When his mind is not\\n                    distracted, he is aware, \\'My mind is not distracted.\\' When his mind has a wider\\n                    scope, he is aware, \\'My mind has widened in scope.\\'When his mind has a narrow\\n                    scope, he is aware, \\'My mind has become narrow in scope.\\' When his mind is\\n                    capable of reaching a higher state, he is aware, \\'My mind is capable of reaching\\n                    a higher state.\\'When his mind is not capable of reaching a higher state, he is\\n                    aware, \\'My mind is not capable of reaching a higher state.\\' When his mind is\\n                    composed, he is aware, \\'My mind is composed.\\'When his mind is not composed, he\\n                    is aware, \\'My mind is not composed.\\' When his mind is free, he is aware, \\'My\\n                    mind is free.\\' When his mind is not free, he is aware, \\'My mind is not free.\\'</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>Desire means to be caught in unwholesome longing. Form, sound, smell, taste, and\\n                    touch are the objects of the five kinds of sense desire, which are desire for\\n                    money, sex, fame, good food, and sleep. These five categories of desire produce\\n                    obstacles on the path of practice as well as many kinds of physical and mental\\n                    suffering.</p>\\n                <p>Whenever the practitioner\\'s mind and thoughts turn to desiring, she immediately\\n                    gives rise to awareness of the presence of that mind. \"This is a mind longing\\n                    for wealth. This is a mind of sexual desire. This is a mind desiring reputation.\\n                    This is the root of the arising of a mind longing for wealth. This is the\\n                    feeling of pain caused by sexual desire.\"</p>\\n                <p>The Satipatthana Sutta teaches that when desiring is not present, the\\n                    practitioner also needs to observe that it is not present. We can practice like\\n                    this: \"At this time, the mind desiring wealth is not present; at this time,\\n                    sexual desire is not present; at this time, the mind desiring reputation is not\\n                    present, etc. This is the root of the absence of the desire for wealth. This is\\n                    the root of the absence of the mind desiring reputation, etc. This is the sense\\n                    of ease that accompanies the absence of the mind desiring riches. This is the\\n                    sense of ease that accompanies the absence of a mind desiring reputation, etc.\"</p>\\n                <p>The Buddha often said that many people confuse desire with happiness. In the\\n                    Magandiya Sutra (Majjhima Nikaya 75), a man who is forced to live in the forest\\n                    because he has leprosy, suffering from severe itching and stinging. He dug a\\n                    hole, filled it with dry branches and logs, and set them on fire. When the fire\\n                    became red-hot charcoal, he stood at the edge of the hole and stretched his arms\\n                    and legs out over it to catch the heat. When he did this, his suffering was\\n                    relieved. On days when he could not make a charcoal fire to warm himself, his\\n                    itching was unbearable. Miraculously, some years later, he was cured of the\\n                    disease and went back to live in the village.</p>\\n                <p>One day he went into the forest and saw a number of lepers dragging their bodies\\n                    to warm themselves by a charcoal fire, and he felt tremendous pity for them. The\\n                    charcoal was extremely hot, he couldn\\'t go near it. If someone had dragged him\\n                    to the hole to warm his body over the charcoal, his suffering would have been\\n                    great. That which in former times had brought him happiness and relief was now a\\n                    source of agony. The Buddha said, \"Desire is also just a hole of burning\\n                    charcoal in the forest. Only those who are sick look on desire as happiness.\"\\n                    Before he became a monk, the Buddha had tasted a life of trying to satisfy the\\n                    five desires, so his words came from experience. True happiness, he said, is a\\n                    life with few desires, few possessions, and the time to enjoy the many wonders\\n                    in us and around us.</p>\\n                <p>The scriptures record how the monk Baddhiya tasted happiness and ease when he\\n                    observed his life of no desire. One night while sitting in meditation at the\\n                    foot of a tree in the Bamboo Forest Monastery, Baddhiya suddenly twice called\\n                    out the words, \"O happiness!\" The next morning, another bhikkhu reported this to\\n                    the Buddha, thinking that the monk Baddhiya regretted losing the high position\\n                    he had had when he was a governor. That afternoon after the Dharma talk, the\\n                    Buddha summoned Baddhiya and asked, \"Is it true that yesterday during your\\n                    meditation you called out twice, \\'O happiness!\\'?\" Baddhiya replied, \"Venerable\\n                    Sir, it is true that last night I called out twice, \\'O happiness!\\'\"</p>\\n                <p>\"Why?\" the Buddha asked him. \"Please tell the community.\"</p>\\n                <p>Baddhiya replied, \"Venerable Sir, when I was a governor, I lived in luxury and\\n                    had great power and influence. Wherever I went, a regiment of soldiers assisted\\n                    me. My residence was guarded day and night, inside and out, by soldiers. In\\n                    spite of this, I was always anxious, afraid, and insecure. Now as a bhikkhu, I\\n                    go into the forest on my own, sit alone at the foot of a tree, sleep alone\\n                    without a curtain or a mat, and I never have any feelings of unease or fear. I\\n                    feel a great sense of ease, joy, and peace that I never felt when I was a\\n                    governor. I do not fear assassins or thieves, because I have nothing to be\\n                    stolen or fought over. I live at ease like a deer in the forest. During last\\n                    night\\'s meditation, I felt clearly that feeling of ease, and that is why I\\n                    raised my voice and called out twice, \\'O happiness!\\' If I disturbed any of my\\n                    fellow practitioners, I sincerely apologize, Venerable Sir.\"</p>\\n                <p>The Buddha praised the monk Baddhiya and said to the community, \"The monk\\n                    Baddhiya is making steady and stable progress on the path of contentment and\\n                    fearlessness. His are the feelings of joy even the gods long for.\"</p>\\n                <p>In the Vijñanavada school of Buddhist psychology, \"desirelessness,\" the\\n                    absence of longing for something, is classified as one of the eleven wholesome\\n                    mental formations. Desirelessness was the basic condition which made possible\\n                    the feelings of joy, peace, and ease that the monk Baddhiya realized while\\n                    living the simple life. Simplicity is to have few desires and to be content with\\n                    just a few possessions. Desirelessness is the basis of true happiness, because\\n                    in true happiness there must be the elements of peace, joy, and ease.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 14 | Observing Anger</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When anger is present in him, he is aware, \\'Anger is present in me.\\'\\n                    When anger\\n                    is not present in him, he is aware, \\'Anger is not present in me.\\' When anger\\n                    begins to arise, he is aware of it.

When anger already abandoned will not arise again in the future,\\n                    he is aware of it.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise is to observe our anger in mindfulness. In Buddhism, we learn that\\n                    a person is comprised of the Five Aggregates of form, feelings, perceptions,\\n                    mental formations, and consciousness. Anger belongs to the aggregate of mental\\n                    formations, and the unpleasant feeling that goes along with the anger belongs to\\n                    the aggregate of feelings. The mastery of our anger is an important step on the\\n                    path of practice. Identifying the presence and the absence of anger in us brings\\n                    many benefits. For our work of mindful observation to be wholehearted, we\\n                    combine the work of observation with conscious breathing.</p>\\n                <p>The first benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is\\n                    that we see that when anger is not present, we are much happier. Anger is like a\\n                    flame blazing up and consuming our self-control, making us think, say, and do\\n                    things that we will probably regret later. The actions of body, speech, and mind\\n                    that we perform while we\\'re angry take us a long way along the road to hell. We\\n                    may never have seen the Avici hells, but we can see clearly that whenever\\n                    someone is angry, he is abiding in one of the hot hells. Anger and hatred are\\n                    the materials of which the Avici hells are made. A mind without\\n                    anger—cool, fresh, and sane—is one of the eleven wholesome mental\\n                    formations. The absence of anger is the basis of real happiness, the basis of\\n                    love and compassion.</p>\\n                <p>The second benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is\\n                    that by just identifying our anger, it loses some of its destructive nature.\\n                    Only when we\\'re angry and not observing our anger mindfully does our anger\\n                    become destructive. When anger is born in us, we should follow our breathing\\n                    closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger. When we do that,\\n                    mindfulness has already been born in us, and anger can no longer monopolize our\\n                    consciousness. Awareness stands alongside the anger: \"I know that I am angry.\"\\n                    This awareness is a companion for the anger. Our mindful observation is not to\\n                    suppress or drive out our anger, but just to look after it. This is a very\\n                    important principle in meditation practice. Mindful observation is like a lamp\\n                    that gives light. It\\'s not a judge. It throws light on our anger, sponsors it,\\n                    looks after it in an affectionate and caring way, like an older sister looking\\n                    after and comforting her younger sibling.</p>\\n                <p>When we\\'re angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase away our anger\\n                    is to suppress or chase away ourselves. When we\\'re joyful, we are joy. When\\n                    we\\'re angry, we are anger. When we love, we are love. When we hate, we are\\n                    hatred. When anger is born, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and\\n                    we can change that energy into another kind of energy. If we want to transform\\n                    it, first we have to know how to accept it. For example, a garbage can filled\\n                    with decomposing and smelly organic material can be transformed into compost and\\n                    later into beautiful roses. At first, we may see the garbage and the flowers as\\n                    separate and opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already\\n                    exist in the garbage, and the garbage already exists in the flowers. The\\n                    beautiful rose contains the garbage in it; if we look carefully, we can see\\n                    that. It only takes one week for a flower to become garbage. The smelly garbage\\n                    already contains beautiful flowers and fragrant herbs, such as coriander and\\n                    basil. When a good organic gardener looks into the garbage can, she can see\\n                    that, and so she does not feel sad or disgusted. Instead, she values the garbage\\n                    and doesn\\'t discriminate against it. It takes only a few months for garbage to\\n                    transform into fragrant herbs and flowers. We also need the insight and nondual\\n                    vision of the organic gardener with regard to anger and despair. We need not be\\n                    afraid of them or reject them. We know that anger is a kind of garbage, but that\\n                    it\\'s within our power to transform it. We need it in the way the organic\\n                    gardener needs compost. If we know how to accept our anger, we already have some\\n                    peace and joy. Gradually we can transform anger completely.</p>\\n                <p>When anger arises, other mental formations, which are lying latent in the depths\\n                    of our consciousness, are not arising. This deep consciousness is called alaya\\n                    by the Vijñanavada school. Joy, sadness, love, and hate, for example, are\\n                    present in alaya when we are angry, but they are lying beneath the surface\\n                    without manifesting, like seeds (Sanskrit: bija) in the ground. If we let the\\n                    anger express itself without giving it a sponsor, it can do a lot of damage\\n                    inside and outside of us. When the mental formation mindfulness arises from\\n                    alaya, it can become the spiritual friend of the mental formation anger. As we\\n                    follow our breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness, the situation\\n                    becomes less and less dangerous. Although the anger is still there, it gradually\\n                    loses its strength and begins to transform into another kind of energy, like\\n                    love or understanding.</p>\\n                <p>Mindfulness is like a lamp illuminating ourselves. As soon as the lamp is brought\\n                    into the room, the room changes. When the sun rises, the light of the sun only\\n                    has to shine onto the plants for them to change, grow, and develop. The light of\\n                    the sun appears not to be doing anything at all, but in truth it is doing a lot.\\n                    Under the influence of the sun, the plants produce chlorophyll and become green.\\n                    It is thanks to the growth of plants that the animal species have what they need\\n                    to survive. If the sun keeps shining on the bud, the flower will open. When the\\n                    light of the sun penetrates the flower bud, the photons transform it, and the\\n                    flower opens. Our mindfulness has the same function as the light of the sun. If\\n                    we shine the light of full awareness steadily on our state of mind, that state\\n                    of mind will transform into something better.</p>\\n                <p>Thanks to the illuminating light of awareness, we can see the roots of our anger.\\n                    The point of meditation is to look deeply into things in order to be able to see\\n                    their nature. The nature of things is interdependent origination, the true\\n                    source of everything that is. If we look into our anger, we can see its roots,\\n                    such as misunderstanding (or ignorance), clumsiness (or lack of skill), the\\n                    surrounding society, hidden resentment, and habit (or our conditioning). These\\n                    roots can be present both in ourselves and in the person who played the\\n                    principal role in allowing the anger to arise. We observe mindfully in order to\\n                    be able to see and to understand. Seeing and understanding are the elements of\\n                    liberation that allow us to be free of the suffering which always accompanies\\n                    anger. Seeing and understanding bring about love and compassion. They are the\\n                    balm of the bodhisattva\\'s compassion that cools our hearts and mind. As we have\\n                    already seen, our anger is a field of energy. Thanks to our mindful observation\\n                    and insight into its roots, we can change this energy into the energy of love\\n                    and compassion—a constructive and healing energy.</p>\\n                <p>Usually when people are angry, they say and do things that cause damage to others\\n                    and themselves. There are people who speak and act in ways that wound others.\\n                    They believe that doing so will release the field of angry energy that is\\n                    burning in their hearts. They shout and scream, beat things, and shoot poisoned\\n                    arrows of speech at others. These methods of release are dangerous.</p>\\n                <p>Sometimes people try to find ways to express their anger in a less dangerous way.\\n                    They may go into their room, close the door behind them, and pound a pillow with\\n                    all their might. Naturally if you beat a pillow until your energy is exhausted,\\n                    your anger will subside, and you\\'ll probably experience a temporary feeling of\\n                    relief—exhaustion is easier to bear than anger—but the roots of the\\n                    anger remain untouched, and when the conditions are right, the same anger will\\n                    arise again. Therefore, the method of mindful observation in order to see and to\\n                    understand the roots of our anger is the only method that has lasting\\n                    effectiveness.</p>\\n                <p>As we\\'ve seen already, when anger arises, we first need to come back to our\\n                    conscious breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness. We concentrate on\\n                    our breathing in order to maintain mindfulness. We avoid listening to or looking\\n                    at the person whom we regard as the cause of our anger. Usually when we\\'re\\n                    angry, we don\\'t return to ourselves and take care of healing our anger. We want\\n                    to think about the hateful aspects of the person who has made us\\n                    angry—rudeness, dishonesty, cruelty, maliciousness, and so on. The more we\\n                    think of them, listen to them, or look at them, the more our anger flares up.\\n                    Their hatefulness may be real, imaginary, or exaggerated, but whatever it is\\n                    that\\'s making us angry, we\\'re inclined to give our full attention to that. In\\n                    fact, the root of our problem is the anger inside of us, and we have to come\\n                    back to it and take care of it first of all. Like a firefighter, we must put\\n                    water on the blaze immediately and not waste time looking for the person who set\\n                    the house on fire. \"Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know\\n                    that I must take care of my anger.\" So it\\'s best not to listen to, look at, or\\n                    think about the other person, or to say or do anything as long as anger\\n                    persists. If we put our mind into the work of observing and calming our anger,\\n                    we\\'ll avoid creating damage that we would probably regret later. We may like to\\n                    go outside and practice walking meditation. The fresh air, green trees, and the\\n                    plants will help us greatly. As we walk, we can recite this verse:</p>\\n                <meditation-verse>\\n                    <p>Breathing in, I know that anger is still here.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out, I know that anger is me.</p>\\n                    <p>And I know that mindfulness is me also.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing in, I know that anger is an unpleasant feeling.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out, I know that this feeling has been born and</p>\\n                    <p>will die.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing in, I know that I can take care of this feeling.</p>\\n                    <p>Breathing out, I calm this feeling.</p>\\n                </meditation-verse>\\n                <p>Mindfulness embraces the feeling, as a mother holds her crying child in her arms\\n                    and transmits all her affection and care. If a mother puts all her heart and\\n                    mind into caring for her baby, the baby will feel the mother\\'s gentleness and\\n                    will calm down. In the same way, we can calm the functioning of our mind.</p>\\n                <p>In order to lessen the unpleasant feeling brought about by the anger, we give our\\n                    whole heart and mind to the practice of walking meditation, combining our breath\\n                    with our steps and giving full attention to the contact between the soles of our\\n                    feet and the earth. After a while, our anger will calm down, and we become\\n                    stronger. Then we can begin to observe the anger and its true nature.</p>\\n                <p>We know that we can\\'t eat potatoes without cooking them first. We fill our pot\\n                    with water, put the lid on, and light the fire. The lid of the pot, which keeps\\n                    the heat inside, is the power of concentration—not to speak, not to\\n                    listen, not to do anything at all, but just to concentrate our whole mind on our\\n                    breathing. As soon as the pot is on the fire, the water begins to get warm. When\\n                    we practice conscious breathing, although our anger is still there, it\\'s\\n                    accompanied by mindfulness, the fire under the potatoes. The anger—the\\n                    potatoes—has started to transform. Half an hour later, the potatoes are\\n                    cooked, and our anger is transformed. We can smile, and we know that we\\n                    understand the roots of our anger, and we can face the person who precipitated\\n                    it.</p>\\n                <p>Our anger is rooted in our lack of understanding of ourselves and of the causes,\\n                    deep-seated as well as immediate, which have brought about this unpleasant state\\n                    of affairs. Anger is also rooted in desire, pride, agitation, and\\n                    suspiciousness. Our method of dealing with events as they arise reflects our\\n                    state of understanding as well as our state of confusion. The chief roots of our\\n                    anger are in ourselves. Our environment and other people are only secondary\\n                    roots.</p>\\n                <p>We can put up with the damage brought about by an earthquake or a flood, but if\\n                    people had caused the same damage, we might not show much patience, and anger\\n                    and hatred may arise in us. But if we know that earthquakes and floods have\\n                    causes, we should also be able to see that there are causes—deep-seated or\\n                    immediate—of the harm done to us by people. We need to see and understand\\n                    these causes also. We have to see hardships brought about by others as a sort of\\n                    natural disaster. These people make our lives difficult because they\\'re\\n                    ignorant, prisoners of their desires or their hatreds. If we speak angrily to\\n                    them and treat them as our enemy, then we\\'re just doing what they are doing, and\\n                    we\\'re no different from them. In order to realize the state of no anger in our\\n                    conscious and subconscious mind, we have to practice the meditations on love and\\n                    compassion.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 15 | Love Meditation</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When anger is not present in him, he is aware, \\'Anger is not present in\\n                    me.\\' When\\n                    already arisen anger is abandoned, he is aware of it.

Love (Pali: metta;\\n                    Sanskrit: maitri) is a mind that is intent on bringing peace, joy, and happiness\\n                    to others. Compassion (Sanskrit: karuna) is a mind that is intent on removing\\n                    the suffering which is present in others. That is the meaning of the phrase,\\n                    \"Love is the capacity to give joy. Compassion is the power to relieve\\n                    suffering.\" When love and compassion are sources of energy in us, they bring\\n                    peace, joy, and happiness to those dear to us and to others also.</p>\\n                <p>We all have the seeds of love and compassion in us, and we can develop these fine\\n                    and wonderful sources of energy. Maitri and karuna aren\\'t the kinds of love that\\n                    try to possess and appropriate, to dictate and bring about suffering for\\n                    ourselves and those we love. Maitri and karuna are the kinds of unconditional\\n                    love that don\\'t expect anything in return. Consequently they don\\'t result in\\n                    anxiety, boredom, or sorrow.</p>\\n                <p>The essence of love and compassion is understanding, the ability to recognize the\\n                    suffering of others. We have to be in touch with the physical, material, and\\n                    psychological suffering of others. To do so, we have to put ourselves \"inside\\n                    the skin\" of the other. We must \"go inside\" their body, feelings, and mental\\n                    formations and experience their suffering. A shallow observation as an outsider\\n                    won\\'t help us see their suffering. In the Satipatthana Sutta, we\\'re taught to be\\n                    one with the object of our observation. We observe the body in the body, the\\n                    feelings in the feelings, the mental formations in the mental formations.</p>\\n                <p>When we\\'re in contact with the suffering of another, a feeling of compassion is\\n                    born in us immediately. Compassion literally means \"to suffer with\" the other.\\n                    Looking in order to see the suffering in another person is the work of\\n                    meditation. If we sit cross-legged, follow our breathing, and observe someone\\n                    mindfully, we can be in contact with his suffering, and the energy of compassion\\n                    arises in us. We can also do this while walking, standing, lying down, sitting,\\n                    speaking, and acting, not just when we are sitting in meditation. The physical\\n                    and psychological suffering of that person will be clear to us in the light of\\n                    our mindful observation.</p>\\n                <p>When the mind of compassion arises, we have to find ways to nourish and express\\n                    it. When we come into contact with the other person, our thoughts and actions\\n                    should express our mind of compassion, even if that person says and does things\\n                    that are not easy to accept. We practice in this way until we see clearly that\\n                    our love is not contingent upon the other person apologizing or being lovable.\\n                    Then we can be sure that our mind of compassion is firm and authentic. We\\'ll\\n                    recognize in ourselves some of the beautiful signs of the compassionate mind:\\n                    (1) our sleep is more relaxed, (2) we do not have nightmares, (3) our\\n                    waking-state is more at ease, (4) we\\'re not anxious or depressed, and (5) we\\'re\\n                    protected by everyone and everything around us. The person who has been the\\n                    object of our meditation on compassion will also, eventually, benefit from our\\n                    meditation. His suffering will slowly diminish, and his life will gradually be\\n                    brighter and more joyful.</p>\\n                <p>We can begin our meditation on compassion with someone who is undergoing\\n                    suffering of a physical or material kind—someone who is weak and easily\\n                    ill, poor, or oppressed, or has no protection. This kind of suffering is easy to\\n                    see. We observe it deeply, either during sitting meditation or when we\\'re\\n                    actually in contact with it. We must have enough time if we\\'re going to be in\\n                    deep contact with the suffering of that person. We have to observe until the\\n                    mind of compassion arises, and the substance of the mind of compassion\\n                    penetrates into our being. Then the mind of compassion will envelop the object\\n                    of our observation. If we observe deeply in this way, the mind of compassion\\n                    will naturally be transformed into action. We won\\'t just say, \"I love her very\\n                    much,\" but instead, \"I must do something so that she\\'ll suffer less.\" The mind\\n                    of compassion is truly present when it has the capacity of removing suffering.</p>\\n                <p>After that, we can practice being in contact with more subtle forms of suffering.\\n                    Sometimes the other person doesn\\'t seem to be suffering at all, but we may\\n                    notice that she has sorrows which have left their marks in hidden ways. Someone\\n                    with more than enough material comforts can also be subject to suffering. There\\n                    are very few people who are not suffering to some degree. The person who has\\n                    made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to sit down, follow\\n                    our breathing, and look deeply, and naturally we\\'ll see her suffering.</p>\\n                <p>We may be able to see how her misery has come about because of the lack of skill\\n                    of the parents who raised her. But her parents may have been the victims of\\n                    their parents. The suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation,\\n                    and it has been reborn in her. If we can see that, we\\'ll no longer blame her for\\n                    making us suffer, because we understand the way in which she is also a victim.\\n                    To look deeply is to understand. Once we understand, it\\'s easy to embrace the\\n                    other person in our mind of compassion.</p>\\n                <p>To look deeply into the suffering of those who have caused us to suffer is a\\n                    miraculous gift. Thanks to our observation, we now know that the person is\\n                    suffering. He may think that his suffering will be lessened if he can cause us\\n                    to suffer. Once we\\'re in touch with his suffering, our enmity and bitterness\\n                    towards him will vanish, and we\\'ll long for him to suffer less. The spring water\\n                    of the compassionate mind begins to flow, and we ourselves are the first to be\\n                    cleansed by it. We feel cool and light, and we can smile. We don\\'t need two\\n                    people to bring about reconciliation. When we look deeply, we become reconciled\\n                    with ourselves and, for us, the problem no longer exists. Sooner or later, the\\n                    other will see our attitude and share in the freshness of the stream of love\\n                    which is flowing naturally in our heart.</p>\\n                <p>After we experience the fruit of the meditation of compassion, the meditation on\\n                    love becomes relatively easy. Just as with the mind of compassion, the mind of\\n                    love brings peace, joy, and happiness to the practitioner first. We know that if\\n                    we don\\'t have peace and joy ourselves, we won\\'t have peace and joy to share with\\n                    others. That\\'s why the meditation on compassion and the meditation on love bring\\n                    benefits both to the practitioner and to others.</p>\\n                <p>When we reduce the suffering in others, we also bring them happiness at the same\\n                    time. Although life is suffering, it also has many wonderful things like the\\n                    early morning sky, the harvest moon, the forsythia bush, the violet bamboo, the\\n                    stream of clear water, and the beautiful child. When we pay attention only to\\n                    our suffering, we\\'re not able to make contact with these wonderful things, and\\n                    anything we say or do will not untie the knot of suffering and bring about the\\n                    conditions for living joyfully. Mindful observation is the element that\\n                    nourishes the tree of understanding, and compassion and love are the most\\n                    beautiful flowers. When we realize the mind of love, we have to go to the one\\n                    who has been the object of our mindful observation, so that our mind of love is\\n                    not just an object of our imagination but is a source of energy that has an\\n                    effect in the real world.</p>\\n                <p>The Buddha teaches that during our meditation we can send our mind of love and\\n                    compassion into the four directions and embrace all species of living beings.\\n                    But we must be careful not to think that the meditations of love and compassion\\n                    consist in just sitting still and imagining that our mind of love and compassion\\n                    will spread out into space like waves of sound or light. Sound and light have\\n                    the ability to penetrate everywhere, and love and compassion can do the same.\\n                    But if our love and compassion are only a kind of imagining—for example,\\n                    if we imagine they are like a pure white cloud that slowly forms and gradually\\n                    spreads out and out to envelop the whole world—then they\\'ll have no\\n                    effect; they\\'re only a cloud of the imagination. A true cloud can produce rain.\\n                    It\\'s only in the midst of our daily life and in our actual contact with people\\n                    and other species, including the object of our meditation, that we can know\\n                    whether our mind of love and compassion is really present and whether it is\\n                    stable. If love and compassion are real, they\\'ll be evident in our daily life,\\n                    in the way we talk with people and the way we act in the world. The sitting\\n                    meditation position is not the only position in which we can give rise to the\\n                    spring water of love and compassion.</p>\\n                <p>Many people think that if they don\\'t have influence and money, they can\\'t realize\\n                    love and compassion. In fact, the source of love and compassion is in us, and we\\n                    can help many people suffer less and realize a lot of happiness without being\\n                    rich or influential. One word, one action, or one thought can reduce another\\n                    person\\'s suffering and bring him joy. One word can give comfort and confidence,\\n                    destroy doubt, help someone avoid a mistake, reconcile a conflict, open the door\\n                    to liberation, or show him the way to success and happiness. One action can save\\n                    a person\\'s life or help him take advantage of a rare opportunity. One thought\\n                    can do the same, because thoughts lead to words and action. If love and\\n                    compassion are in our hearts, every thought, word, and deed can bring about a\\n                    miracle. Because understanding is the very foundation of love and compassion,\\n                    the words and actions engendered by love and compassion will be ones that are\\n                    helpful. When we want to help, we know how to avoid the kind of love that does\\n                    more harm than good. We must always remember that love is none other than\\n                    understanding.</p>\\n            </section>\\n        </section> <!-- section level 2\\n        exercise group for the mind -->\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"exercise_group\">\\n            <title>EXERCISES FOR OBSERVING THE OBJECTS OF MIND</title>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 16 | Discriminative Investigation</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When the factor of awakening, investigation-of-phenomena, is present in\\n                    him, he\\n                    is aware, \\'Investigation-of-phenomena is present in me.\\' He is aware when\\n                    not-yet-born investigation-of-phenomena is being born and when already-born\\n                    investigation-of-phenomena is perfectly developed.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>Ignorance, or delusion, is the erroneous perception of things. In order to\\n                    correct our erroneous perceptions, the Buddha teaches us a method of\\n                    discriminative investigation, which relates to the establishment of the mind and\\n                    the establishment of the objects of mind. The objects of mind are also called\\n                    dharmas (all that can be conceived of as existing). They include the six sense\\n                    organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses. The six sense\\n                    organs are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The six sense objects\\n                    are form and color, sound, smell, taste, tactile objects, and mind-objects\\n                    (every concept and every thing that belongs to the sphere of memory and mental\\n                    experience). The sense six consciousnesses are: eye-consciousness (or sight),\\n                    ear-consciousness (or hearing), nose-consciousness (or smelling),\\n                    taste-consciousness (or tasting), body-consciousness (or touching), and\\n                    mind-consciousness. All dharmas are contained within these Eighteen Realms\\n                    (Sanskrit: dhatu), which include all psychological, physiological, and physical\\n                    aspects. All Eighteen Realms are also called objects of mind, including mental\\n                    formations. When mind is observing mind, the mind becomes an object of mind.</p>\\n                <p>The basic characteristic of all dharmas is interdependent origination. All\\n                    dharmas arise, endure, and fade away according to the law of interdependence. In\\n                    the Majjhima Nikaya, it is taught: \"This is, because that is; this is not,\\n                    because that is not. This is produced, because that is produced. This is\\n                    destroyed, because that is destroyed.\" The Buddhist principle of\\n                    interdependence, put forward with the utmost simplicity, is immeasurably deep.\\n                    According to this teaching, no single dharma can arise by itself, endure by\\n                    itself, and fade away by itself. The coming-to-be of one dharma is dependent on\\n                    the coming-to-be, endurance, and destruction of other dharmas, in fact, of all\\n                    other dharmas. Dharmas do not have independent existence. They\\'re empty of a\\n                    separate, independent existence.</p>\\n                <p>In our daily life, we\\'re inclined to perceive things as real and independent of\\n                    each other. Take, for example, a leaf we see on the branch in front of us. We\\n                    may think that this leaf exists independently of all the other leaves,\\n                    independently of the branch, the trunk, and the roots of the tree; independently\\n                    of the clouds, the water, the earth, and the sky. In truth, this leaf could not\\n                    be here without the presence of all the other things that we see as different\\n                    from it. This leaf is one with the other leaves, the branch, the trunk, and the\\n                    roots of the tree; with the clouds, the river, the earth, the sky, and the\\n                    sunlight. If any one of these things were not present, the leaf could not be. If\\n                    we look deeply into the leaf, we can see the presence of all these things. The\\n                    leaf and these things are present together. This is the principle of interbeing\\n                    and interpenetration, the principle of one is all and all is one, which the\\n                    Avatamsaka Sutra, the most complete and sufficient expression of the Buddhist\\n                    principle of interdependent origination, teaches. Things do not exist outside of\\n                    each other. Things exist within each other and with each other. That is why the\\n                    Buddha said: \"This is, because that is.\" With the power of concentration, we can\\n                    observe all that is in the light of this principle. All phenomena in the\\n                    universe, including the thoughts, words, and feelings of both ourselves and\\n                    those around us, need to be observed in the light of interdependence.</p>\\n                <p>This method of discriminative investigation begins by classifying the dharmas\\n                    into categories like the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six\\n                    sense consciousnesses, namely, the Eighteen Realms, which can also be classified\\n                    according to the Five Aggregates of form, feeling, perceptions, mental\\n                    formations, and consciousness. By \"form,\" we mean all physiological and physical\\n                    phenomena. \"Feelings\" means pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings.\\n                    \"Perceptions\" means basic conceptualizations and naming. \"Mental formations\"\\n                    means psychological states that arise and manifest in us. \"Consciousness\" is the\\n                    function of maintaining, cognizing, comparing, storing, and remembering all the\\n                    seeds. The basic Abhidharma writings and the teachings of the Vijñanavada\\n                    school of Buddhist psychology give very thorough explanations of the essential\\n                    nature of these five categories and the ways in which they function.</p>\\n                <p>The Heart of the Prajñaparamita Sutra tells us that the Bodhisattva\\n                    Avalokita, thanks to his observation of the Five Aggregates, was able to see the\\n                    interdependent nature of all dharmas and realize their essential birthlessness\\n                    and deathlessness, and so transcend the fear of birth and death. The same sutra\\n                    refers to the essential emptiness (Sanskrit: sunyata) of all dharmas. Emptiness,\\n                    here, means interdependence. All dharmas depend on each other in order to arise\\n                    and to endure. There is no dharma which can exist apart from other dharmas, and\\n                    that is why we say that the real nature of dharmas is emptiness. Nothing can\\n                    exist on its own.</p>\\n                <p>Through discriminative investigation, we realize the interdependent nature of all\\n                    that is. This is to realize the empty nature of all things. With insight into\\n                    emptiness, we\\'ll go beyond concepts of \"it is\" and \"it is not,\" birth and death,\\n                    one and many, coming and going, and we\\'ll transcend the fear of birth and death.\\n                    Our concepts of it is/it is not, birth/death, one/many, coming/going, and so on,\\n                    will dissolve when we\\'re witness to the interdependent nature of all that is. To\\n                    be able to end the concept of birth and death is the essential point of\\n                    discriminative investigation.</p>\\n                <p>Some days before the layman Anathapindika passed away, the Buddha sent the\\n                    Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Ananda to visit him and instruct him in\\n                    his practice. Sitting at the layman\\'s bedside, the Venerable Sariputra began his\\n                    instruction: \"Layman Anathapindika, you should meditate like this: \\'These eyes\\n                    are not me. I am not caught in these eyes.\\' \" Anathapindika breathed and\\n                    meditated according to the instructions. Sariputra continued his instructions:\\n                    \"These ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not me. I am not caught by forms,\\n                    sounds, smells, tastes, contacts, or the thoughts that I have.\" Anathapindika\\n                    observed in this way in order to see gradually the interdependent nature of all\\n                    that is, to see that he himself was not restricted to the Eighteen Realms (the\\n                    six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses), and\\n                    to see that there\\'s no birth that brings us into existence and no death that\\n                    takes us from existence to nonexistence.</p>\\n                <p>When he had practiced this much, Anathapindika began to weep, the tears falling\\n                    down his cheeks. The Venerable Ananda asked, \"What is it? Do you regret\\n                    anything? Did you not succeed in the meditation?\" Anathapindika replied,\\n                    \"Venerable Ananda, I have nothing to regret, and my meditation has been very\\n                    successful. I\\'m crying because I am so moved. I have been lucky enough to have\\n                    served the Buddha and his community for many years, but I have never heard a\\n                    teaching so deep, so wonderful, and so precious as the teaching transmitted by\\n                    the Venerable Sariputra today.\"</p>\\n                <p>\"Layman Anathapindika, do you not know that the Buddha is always giving this\\n                    teaching to monks and nuns?\" Ananda said.</p>\\n                <p>\"Venerable Ananda, please tell the Buddha that laypersons such as myself could\\n                    also listen to this wonderful teaching. There are laypeople who are too busy to\\n                    hear, understand, and put into practice these wonderful and deep teachings, but\\n                    there are also laypeople with the capacity to listen, understand, and put into\\n                    practice these wonderful and deep teachings.\"</p>\\n                <p>This excerpt about the layman Anathapindika (Majjhima Nikaya 143) shows us that\\n                    anyone can practice the mindful observation of the interdependent and empty\\n                    nature of things, not just monks or nuns. The life of a layperson is not so busy\\n                    that he is not able to enjoy the taste of the highest teachings of Buddhism.</p>\\n                <p>The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness also describes the mind that\\n                    is not in a state of ignorance and confusion, as when we are conscious of\\n                    impermanence, interdependence, and selflessness; when our mind rests in Right\\n                    View. Right View is one of the eight ways of practice called the Noble Eightfold\\n                    Path.</p>\\n                <p>In the section that teaches how to be mindful of the objects of mind, among the\\n                    Seven Factors of Awakening (Sanskrit: saptabodhyanga), the investigation of\\n                    dharmas is mentioned. Investigation of dharmas means the detailed examination of\\n                    the source and the nature of phenomena whether physical or psychological.\\n                    Investigation of dharmas has a meaning similar to discriminative investigation\\n                    and is also intended to see the source and the nature of dharmas. If we can\\n                    understand in depth the source and the nature of dharmas, then our mind is not\\n                    in a state of ignorance or confusion.</p>\\n                <p>Each of the above fifteen exercises from the Satipatthana Sutta has, to a greater\\n                    or lesser degree, the function of mindfully observing the source of dharmas. The\\n                    most obvious examples are the eighth exercise—observation of the\\n                    interdependence of the body and all that is in the universe: earth, water, air,\\n                    and fire—and the twelfth exercise—the observation of the source and\\n                    the nature of our feelings.</p>\\n                <p>When sitting in meditation, we concentrate our mind on the object of our\\n                    observation—sometimes a physical phenomenon, sometimes\\n                    psychological—and we look deeply into that object in order to discover its\\n                    source and its nature. The role of our conscious breathing is to nourish and\\n                    maintain our power of concentration on one object. If we look carefully and\\n                    deeply, naturally we\\'ll see that the arising, enduring, and ending of the object\\n                    is dependent on other things. Eventually we\\'ll see that the true nature of all\\n                    dharmas is birthlessness and deathlessness, and that although dharmas are not\\n                    everlasting, they\\'re never totally destroyed. Thus the mindful observation of\\n                    interdependence is the road that leads us to transcend the limits of birth and\\n                    death. A student of Buddhism who doesn\\'t practice the mindful observation of\\n                    interdependence hasn\\'t yet arrived at the quintessence of the Buddhist path.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 17 | Observing Internal Formations</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>He is aware of the eyes [ears, nose, tongue, body, mind] and aware of\\n                    the form\\n                    [sound, smell, taste, touch, objects of mind], and he is aware of the internal\\n                    formations which are produced in dependence on these two things. He is aware of\\n                    the birth of a new internal formation and is aware of abandoning an already\\n                    produced internal formation, and he is aware when an already abandoned internal\\n                    formation will not arise again.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>In the section of the sutra that refers to the observation of the six sense\\n                    organs and the six sense objects, we see the term \"internal formations.\" The\\n                    word in Sanskrit is samyojana, which can also be translated as \"knots,\"\\n                    \"fetters,\" \"agglomeration,\" or \"binding together.\"</p>\\n                <p>Internal formations can be classified as two kinds, the Five Dull Knots:\\n                    confusion, desire, anger, pride, and doubt; and the Five Sharp Knots: view of\\n                    the body as self, extreme views, wrong views, perverted views, and superstitious\\n                    views (or unnecessary ritual prohibitions). The latter are easier to correct.\\n                    When the eyes see form, the ears hear sound, the nose smells a scent, the tongue\\n                    tastes something, the body touches something, or the mind cognizes an object,\\n                    knots may or may not be tied, depending on the way in which our mind receives\\n                    these impressions. When someone speaks unkindly to us, if we understand the\\n                    reason and we do not take the words to heart, we won\\'t feel at all irritated,\\n                    and a knot won\\'t be formed in our mind. If we don\\'t understand the reason and we\\n                    feel irritated, a knot will form. The substance of this knot will be hatred.\\n                    When we misunderstand someone\\'s words or behavior, the knot that forms is\\n                    confusion, which often gives rise to irritation, pride, attachment, and doubt.\\n                    The knot of confusion, a lack of clear seeing, or ignorance (Sanskrit: avidya),\\n                    is the basis for every other knot.</p>\\n                <p>The feelings associated with internal formations are usually unpleasant, but\\n                    sometimes internal formations are associated with pleasant feelings. When we are\\n                    attached to a form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or mind object, an internal\\n                    formation of the nature of desire is formed. To begin with, it can be associated\\n                    with a pleasant feeling. But because we become attached to it, we are bound, and\\n                    when the demands of the attachment are not met, the feelings become unpleasant.\\n                    Anything from wine, tobacco, or opium to beautiful forms, good food, music, or\\n                    words of praise can produce a knot in us, an internal formation that begins as a\\n                    pleasant feeling. Once we have a such a knot, we are tied tightly by it, and we\\n                    are forced to seek out the object of sense again and again in order to repeat\\n                    the pleasant feeling.</p>\\n                <p>Falling in love is also an internal formation, because in it there is the\\n                    material of blind attachment. The term to \"fall\" in love in itself sounds\\n                    disastrous. People often refer to love-sickness, as if falling in love were a\\n                    disease. The French expression coup de foudre (struck by lightning) describes\\n                    falling in love as a sharp blow. The author Nguyên Bính has said,\\n                    \"Alas, only the gods can save someone who has fallen in love.\" But being in love\\n                    can be transformed, so that blind attachment, selfishness, and domination are\\n                    replaced by the capacity to understand and bring happiness to the person we\\n                    love, without demanding specific conditions and expecting something in return.\\n                    To transform being in love in this way is to transform an internal formation.</p>\\n                <p>Feelings of sorrow in us are also internal formations that arise from confusion,\\n                    desire, hatred, pride, and doubt. If these roots of affliction are not\\n                    transformed, the feelings of sorrow will remain intact in us. In everyday life,\\n                    seeds of sorrow can be sown in our consciousness with or without the\\n                    collaboration of others. Others may say or do things that produce knots in us,\\n                    but if we give birth to the seeds of understanding, tolerance, love, and\\n                    compassion, then what they say and do will not produce any internal formations\\n                    in us. It depends on the way in which we receive what happens to us in our daily\\n                    lives. If we are stable, relaxed, understanding, loving, compassionate, and not\\n                    caught in egotism, then the things others do and say will not have the force to\\n                    produce an internal formation in us.</p>\\n                <p>If we live according to the teachings of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness,\\n                    we practice mindful observation of the arising, duration, and transformation of\\n                    internal formations. In our daily life, we practice full awareness in order to\\n                    be able to recognize the internal formation just born and find a way to\\n                    transform it. If we allow internal formations to grow strong in us, the time\\n                    will come when they will dominate us, and the work of transforming them will be\\n                    extremely difficult. An internal formation of hatred, desire, or doubt needs our\\n                    full attention as soon as it arises so that it may be transformed. When it\\n                    arises for the first time, the knot is still very \"loose\" and the work of\\n                    \"untying it\" is easy.</p>\\n                <p>When we live with another person, we should help each other transform the\\n                    internal formations that we have produced in each other. By practicing\\n                    understanding and loving speech, we can help each other a great deal. Happiness\\n                    is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not\\n                    be happy either. Therefore, to transform the internal formations in the other is\\n                    to bring about our own happiness as well. A person can create internal\\n                    formations in her partner, and her partner can do so for her, and if they\\n                    continue to create knots in each other, one day they\\'ll have no happiness left.\\n                    A person needs to recognize quickly any newly formed knot inside herself. She\\n                    should take the time to observe it and, with her partner\\'s help, transform the\\n                    internal formation. She might say, \"Darling, I have an internal formation. Can\\n                    you please help me?\" This is easy when the states of mind of both partners are\\n                    still light and not loaded with many internal formations.</p>\\n                <p>As we have already seen, the material of any internal formation is ignorance or\\n                    confusion. If we can see the ignorance that is present during the creation of a\\n                    knot, we can easily untie it. In the twelfth exercise (mindfully observing the\\n                    source and nature of feelings), the fourteenth exercise (mindfully observing\\n                    anger), and the fifteenth exercise (observing with compassion), we have seen\\n                    that if we\\'re aware of interdependence and multiple causation, we can see the\\n                    roots and the nature of our mind and transform and transcend unpleasant states.\\n                    Mindful observation is to look and be able to see the nature of dharmas. The\\n                    transformation of an internal formation is the result of this insight.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 18 | Transforming Internal Formations</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>He is aware of the eyes [ears, nose, tongue, body, mind] and aware of\\n                    the form\\n                    [sound, smell, taste, touch, objects of mind], and he is aware of the internal\\n                    formations which are produced in dependence on these two things.

[This is the same quote as in Exercise 17.]</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>This exercise aims at putting us in touch with and transforming internal\\n                    formations that are buried and repressed in ourselves. The internal formations\\n                    of desire, anger, fear, feeling worthless, and regret have been suppressed in\\n                    our subconscious for a long time. Although they are suppressed, they are always\\n                    seeking ways to manifest in our feelings, thoughts, words, and actions. It is\\n                    easy for us to observe our internal formations when they appear as feelings on\\n                    the surface of consciousness, but internal formations that are repressed cannot\\n                    appear in a direct and natural way in the conscious mind. They only disclose\\n                    themselves indirectly. Thus we\\'re not aware of their presence, although they\\n                    continue to tie us up and make us suffer in a latent way.</p>\\n                <p>What is it that represses them and does not let them appear? It is our conscious,\\n                    reasoning mind. We know that our desires and anger are not wholly acceptable to\\n                    society and to our own reasoning mind, so we\\'ve found a way to repress them, to\\n                    push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to be able to forget\\n                    them. This is the work of a mental formation called mushita smrti,\\n                    forgetfulness. Contemporary psychology understands repression. Because we want\\n                    to avoid suffering, there are defense mechanisms in us that push our\\n                    psychological pains, conflicts, and unacceptable desires into our unconscious so\\n                    that we can feel more at peace with ourselves. But our longstanding repressions\\n                    are always looking for ways to manifest in words, images, and behavior\\n                    unacceptable to society and can later become symptoms of physical and\\n                    psychological illness. We may know that our words, thoughts, and behavior are\\n                    destructive, but we can\\'t do anything about them because our internal formations\\n                    are so strong.</p>\\n                <p>Take for example a daughter who, on the one hand, wants to be with a partner or\\n                    do her own things in the world, and on the other hand does not want to leave her\\n                    mother to live all alone. The daughter understands and loves her mother, but she\\n                    also wants to be independent and/or live with the person she loves. However, her\\n                    mother is sick and needs someone to support her, and the daughter can\\'t bear the\\n                    thought of leaving her alone. The opposing desires and feelings bring about an\\n                    internal conflict in the daughter. And so her defense mechanism represses the\\n                    pain of the conflict in her unconscious and tells her to devote her life to\\n                    supporting her mother. Nevertheless, the desire to be with her own partner is\\n                    still there, and the psychological conflict remains an internal formation\\n                    looking for a way to manifest. She becomes irritable and says things which even\\n                    she herself does not understand, and she has dreams which are incomprehensible\\n                    to her. She is not happy, and so her mother can\\'t be happy either. In fact, her\\n                    mother has been haunted for years by the fear that her daughter will leave her,\\n                    and it is this psychological factor that made her unexpectedly fall sick and\\n                    grow weak, although she\\'s not aware of it. When she heard her daughter say that\\n                    she was going to stay, she was very pleased, but in the depths of her heart, she\\n                    suffers because she knows that her daughter is prevented from doing something\\n                    she wants to do. This conflict becomes an internal formation in the mother,\\n                    which makes her suffer, and the mother also becomes irritable and says things\\n                    which she herself does not understand. She also has dreams she doesn\\'t\\n                    understand, and she does things without knowing why she\\'s doing them. Neither\\n                    the mother nor the daughter is happy, and both continue to suffer.</p>\\n                <p>The method of curing the sorrow that comes when internal formations are repressed\\n                    is the deep observation of these internal formations. But to observe them, first\\n                    of all we have to find ways to bring them into the realm of the conscious mind.\\n                    The method of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is to practice\\n                    conscious breathing in order to recognize our feelings, thoughts, words, and\\n                    actions, especially those which arise automatically, as reactions to what is\\n                    happening. Our reactions may have their roots in the internal formations buried\\n                    inside us.</p>\\n                <p>When we\\'re aware of what we are feeling, thinking, and doing, we can ask\\n                    ourselves questions like: Why do I feel uncomfortable when I hear someone say\\n                    that? Why do I always think of my mother when I see that woman? Why did I say\\n                    that to him? Why didn\\'t I like that character in the film? Whom did I hate in\\n                    the past who this person resembles? Practices like this can help us discover the\\n                    roots of our feelings, thoughts, words, and behavior and gradually bring the\\n                    internal formations buried in us into the realm of the conscious mind.</p>\\n                <p>During our sitting meditation, because we have closed the doors of our sensory\\n                    input in order to stop listening, looking, and reasoning, the internal\\n                    formations that are buried in us have the opportunity to reveal themselves in\\n                    the form of feelings or images that manifest in our conscious mind. To begin\\n                    with, there may be just a feeling of anxiety, fear, or unpleasantness, whose\\n                    cause we can\\'t see. We have to shine the light of mindfulness on it and be ready\\n                    to see this feeling.</p>\\n                <p>When this feeling begins to show its face and to gather strength and become more\\n                    intense, we may feel it robs us of all our peace, joy, and ease. We may not want\\n                    to be in contact with it anymore. We may want to move our attention to another\\n                    object of meditation. We may not want to continue with the meditation, and we\\n                    may say that we\\'re sleepy and would prefer to meditate some other time. In\\n                    modern psychology, this is called resistance. Deep down we are afraid to bring\\n                    into our conscious mind the feelings of pain that are buried within us, because\\n                    they\\'ll make us suffer.</p>\\n                <p>There are people who practice sitting meditation many hours a day, but they do\\n                    not really dare to face and invite their feelings of pain into their conscious\\n                    mind. They deceive themselves that these feelings aren\\'t important and they give\\n                    their attention to other subjects of meditation—impermanence,\\n                    selflessness, the sound of one hand clapping, or the reason Bodhidharma came to\\n                    the West. This isn\\'t to suggest that these subjects are unimportant, but they\\n                    should be considered in the light of our real problems in order to be authentic\\n                    subjects for meditation practice.</p>\\n                <p>We don\\'t practice mindfulness in Buddhism in order to repress our feelings, but\\n                    as a way of looking after our feelings, being their sponsor in an affectionate,\\n                    nonviolent way. When we\\'re able to maintain mindfulness, we\\'re not carried away\\n                    by or drowned in our feelings or in the conflicts within ourselves. We nourish\\n                    and maintain mindfulness through conscious breathing and try to become aware of\\n                    our internal formations and conflicts as they manifest. We receive them with\\n                    love as a mother takes her child in her arms: \"Mindfulness is present, and I\\n                    know that I have enough strength to be in contact with the knots in me.\" In this\\n                    kind of an environment, our internal formations will manifest as feelings and\\n                    images in our mind that we can contact and identify fully and deeply.</p>\\n                <p>Without judgment, blame, or criticism for having these feelings or images, we\\n                    just observe, identify, and accept them in order to see their source and their\\n                    true nature. If there\\'s pain, we feel the pain. If there\\'s sadness, we are sad.\\n                    If there\\'s anger, then we are angry, but our anger is accompanied by\\n                    mindfulness. We don\\'t lose ourselves in the pain, the sadness, or the anger, but\\n                    we calm them down. Even if we haven\\'t seen the roots of the internal formations,\\n                    the fact that we can greet our pain, our sadness, and our anger in mindfulness\\n                    already causes our internal knots to lose some of their strength. Thanks to our\\n                    vigilant observation, eventually we\\'ll see their roots and transform them. The\\n                    teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness on how to be in\\n                    direct contact with our feelings and invite them up to manifest on the surface\\n                    of our consciousness is wonderfully effective. The practitioner can work with\\n                    difficult internal formations with the help of a teacher or of a\\n                    co-practitioner. The teacher and the co-practitioners, because of their mindful\\n                    observation, can help point out to him the manifestations of the internal\\n                    formations that lie deep in his consciousness.</p>\\n                <p>In his lifetime, the Buddha was praised as being a King of Doctors, and he helped\\n                    thousands of people, including King Ajatasatru of Magadha, deal with mental\\n                    problems. Those who practice mindful observation can learn the Buddhist way of\\n                    dealing with internal formations in order to help themselves and others. Because\\n                    many people live without practicing mindfulness and don\\'t know how to transform\\n                    internal formations, over time these internal formations become strong and lead\\n                    to agitation, anxiety, and depression, which express themselves in speech and\\n                    behavior that are not easily acceptable by society. Those with strong internal\\n                    formations have difficulty relating to and working with others, and these\\n                    difficulties make them feel more and more unsuccessful in society. As their\\n                    internal formations increase, their behavior becomes more and more\\n                    inappropriate, and eventually, the pressure may become so great that they\\'ll\\n                    have to quit their job or abandon their marriage.</p>\\n                <p>If we know how to live every moment in an awakened way, we\\'ll be aware of what\\'s\\n                    happening in our feelings and perceptions in the present moment and won\\'t let\\n                    internal formations become too tight in our consciousness. If we know how to\\n                    observe our feelings, we can find the causes of longstanding internal formations\\n                    and transform them.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 19 | Overcoming Guilt and Fear</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When agitation and remorse are present in him, he is aware, \\'Agitation\\n                    and\\n                    remorse are present in me.\\'When agitation and remorse are not present in him, he\\n                    is aware, \\'Agitation and remorse are not present in me.\\' When agitation and\\n                    remorse begin to arise, he is aware of it.

When it\\'s utilized to recognize\\n                    errors we\\'ve made and to resolve not to commit the same mistakes in the future,\\n                    then regret is a wholesome mental formation. If regret creates a guilt-complex\\n                    that follows and haunts us, then it\\'s an obstacle to our practice.</p>\\n                <p>We have all made mistakes in the past. But these mistakes can be erased. We may\\n                    think that because the past is gone, we can\\'t return to the past to correct our\\n                    mistakes. But the past has created the present, and if we practice mindfulness\\n                    in the present, we naturally are in contact with the past. As we transform the\\n                    present, we also transform the past. Our ancestors, parents, brothers, and\\n                    sisters are all closely linked to us—our suffering and happiness is\\n                    closely linked to theirs, just as their suffering and happiness is closely\\n                    linked to ours. If we can transform ourselves, we also transform them. Our own\\n                    emancipation, peace, and joy is the emancipation, peace, and joy of our\\n                    ancestors and our parents. To take hold of the present in order to transform it\\n                    is the unique way to bring peace, joy, and emancipation to those we love and to\\n                    heal the damage done in the past.</p>\\n                <p>Confession in Buddhism is based on the fact that we commit errors by means of our\\n                    mind, and so by means of our mind those errors can be erased. If we take hold of\\n                    life in the present moment in order to transform ourselves, we can create joy\\n                    for ourselves and for everyone else as well. This transformation will bring\\n                    about real joy and peace in the present and also in the future. It\\'s not just a\\n                    hollow promise to do better. If we can take hold of our breathing and live in a\\n                    mindful way, thus bringing joy and happiness to ourselves and others in the\\n                    present moment, we can overcome our complexes of guilt so that we\\'re no longer\\n                    paralyzed by them.</p>\\n                <p>For example, the guilt complex that follows someone who has caused the death of a\\n                    child out of mindlessness is a very strong complex. But if that person practices\\n                    mindfulness and is able to be in real contact with the present moment, knowing\\n                    what to do and what not to do in the present moment, she can save the lives of\\n                    many children. Many small children die for want of medicine. Many children die\\n                    through accidents or for want of proper care and attention. So she can work to\\n                    save the children who are dying instead of imprisoning herself and dying slowly\\n                    in the chains of regret.</p>\\n                <p>Fear is also a dominant internal formation in many of us. The ground of fear is\\n                    ignorance, the failure to understand our \"not-self\" nature. Insecurity and fear\\n                    of what might happen to us and those dear to us are feelings we all have, but\\n                    for some, these insecurities and fears dominate their consciousness. In Mahayana\\n                    Buddhism, the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara is described as the one who has\\n                    transcended all fear. He offers all beings the gift of non-fear (Sanskrit:\\n                    abhaya), which comes from the mindful observation of the no-birth, no-death,\\n                    no-increase, and no-decrease nature of all that is. The Prajñaparamita Heart\\n                    Sutra is an exhortation on fearlessness. If we can observe deeply the\\n                    interdependent and selfless nature of all things, we can see that there is no\\n                    birth and no death and pass beyond all fear.<footnote-ref id=\"4\">4</footnote-ref></p>\\n                <p>Since everything is impermanent, disease and accidents can happen to us or to\\n                    those we love at any time. We must accept this reality. If we live every moment\\n                    of our lives mindfully and relate beautifully with those around us, we\\'ll have\\n                    nothing to fear and nothing to regret, even when there is a crisis in our lives.\\n                    If we know that birth and death are both necessary aspects of life, we\\'ll see\\n                    that if our mother the Earth has brought us to life once, she will bring us to\\n                    life one hundred thousand times more, and we will not be afraid or suffer when\\n                    she reaches out her arms to welcome us back. An Awakened One remains unperturbed\\n                    while riding the waves of birth and death.</p>\\n                <p>Some people, because they received so many internal formations during childhood,\\n                    are obsessed by feelings of insecurity. Their parents may have terrorized them,\\n                    filled them with guilt, and exploited them. For people like this, receiving and\\n                    practicing the Five Mindfulness Trainings is a most effective means of\\n                    protection. Practicing the mindfulness trainings, they will be able to\\n                    reestablish the balance between themselves and their environment. Taking and\\n                    observing the trainings is an effective means for healing the wounds of the past\\n                    and influencing society for the better in the present and the future. Practicing\\n                    mindfulness in order to guard the six senses, dwell in the present moment, and\\n                    be in contact with life is a wonderful way of establishing a sense of security\\n                    in everyday life. If in addition we have friends who also observe and practice\\n                    mindfulness, our practice will have a firm and stable support.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <section level=\"3\" type=\"exercise\">\\n                <title>Exercise 20| Sowing Seeds of Peace</title>\\n                <sutra-quote>When the factor of awakening, joy (ease, letting go), is present in\\n                    him, he is\\n                    aware, \\'Joy is present in me.\\' When joy is not present in him, he is aware, \\'Joy\\n                    is not present in me.\\' He is aware when not-yet-born joy is being born and when\\n                    already-born joy is perfectly developed.</sutra-quote>\\n                <p>The purpose of this exercise is to sow and water the seeds of peace, joy, and\\n                    liberation in us. If internal formations are the seeds of suffering, then joy,\\n                    peace, and liberation are the seeds of happiness.</p>\\n                <p>Buddhist psychology talks of seeds as the basis of every state of mind and the\\n                    content of our consciousness. Certain seeds were transmitted to us by our\\n                    parents and our ancestors. These are seeds of Buddha, Bodhisattva,\\n                    Pratyekabuddha (one who has reached liberation by one\\'s own efforts but just for\\n                    one\\'s own sake), Sravaka (one who practices as a disciple by listening to the\\n                    teachings), God, Human, Warrior-God, Animal, Hungry Ghost, and Hell-Being. This\\n                    means that before we were born, there were already many kinds of wholesome and\\n                    unwholesome seeds in us. In addition, there are many kinds of seeds that form in\\n                    us from an early age, planted by our family, school, and society. Seeds that\\n                    produce suffering we can call \"unwholesome,\" and seeds that produce happiness we\\n                    can call \"wholesome.\"</p>\\n                <p>According to the principle of interdependent origination, seeds do not have a\\n                    fixed nature. Every seed is dependent on every other seed for its existence, and\\n                    in any one seed, all the other seeds are present. Any unwholesome seed contains\\n                    within it the germ of wholesome seeds, and a wholesome seed contains within it\\n                    the germ of unwholesome seeds. Just as there has to be night for there to be day\\n                    and death for there to be birth, an unwholesome seed can be transformed into a\\n                    wholesome seed, and a wholesome seed can be transformed into an unwholesome\\n                    seed. This fact tells us that in the darkest times of our lives, in the times of\\n                    the greatest suffering, the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness are still present\\n                    in us. If we know how to contact the seeds of joy, peace, and happiness that are\\n                    already present in us, and if we know how to water and look after them, they\\n                    will germinate and bring us the fruits of peace, joy, and liberation.</p>\\n                <p>The sutra is always reminding us of the two contrasting aspects of the mind. The\\n                    state of mind that has no desire is a wholesome state of mind called\\n                    \"desirelessness.\" The state of mind that has no anger is a wholesome state of\\n                    mind called \"no-anger.\" Desirelessness, no-anger, and freedom are wholesome\\n                    seeds in the mind that need to be watered and cared for.</p>\\n                <p>The sutras often refer to the mind as a plot of ground in which all sorts of\\n                    seeds are sown. That is why we have the Sanskrit term cittabhumi, \"the mind as\\n                    the earth.\" When we practice mindfulness, we should not just observe the\\n                    phenomena of birth, old age, sickness, death, desire, hatred, aversion,\\n                    ignorance, doubt, and wrong views. We should also take the time to observe\\n                    objects of the mind that lead to health, joy, and emancipation in order to\\n                    enable wholesome seeds to germinate and flower in the field of the mind.\\n                    Observing Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, love, compassion, joy, letting go,\\n                    mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, ease, happiness, and equanimity, is\\n                    always encouraged in Buddhism. Joy (Sanskrit: mudita), for example, is not just\\n                    the joy that arises from the joy of others, but also the feeling of well-being\\n                    that arises in ourselves. Mudita is one of the Four Unlimited Minds; love,\\n                    compassion, and letting go or equanimity are the other three. The seeds of\\n                    mudita are in all of us. Only when we have joy in our lives can we be happy and\\n                    have the means to share our happiness with others. If we do not have joy, what\\n                    can we share with others? If the seeds of our joy are buried under many layers\\n                    of suffering, how can we smile and share joy with others? This exercise helps us\\n                    stay in touch with the wholesome seeds in us so that they have a chance to\\n                    develop.</p>\\n                <p>Life is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonderful things.\\n                    There is spring as well as winter, light as well as darkness, health as well as\\n                    sickness, gentle breezes and delightful rains as well as tempests and floods.\\n                    Our eyes, ears, hearts, half-smiles, and breathing are wonderful phenomena. We\\n                    only need to open our eyes and we can see the blue sky, the white clouds, the\\n                    rose, the clear river, the golden fields of wheat, the shining eyes of a child.\\n                    We only have to attune our ears to hear the whispering pines and the waves\\n                    washing up on the shore. Everything is impermanent. Everything is in a temporary\\n                    form. Nevertheless, there are many wonderful things. In us and around us, there\\n                    are so many wondrous phenomena in nature that can refresh and heal us. If we can\\n                    be in contact with them, we will receive their healing benefits. If peace and\\n                    joy are in our hearts, we will gradually bring more peace and joy to the world.</p>\\n                <p>The blue sky, the white clouds, the gentle breezes, the delightful rains,\\n                    political stability, free speech, good schools for children, beautiful flowers,\\n                    and good health—these are the positive ingredients of peace and happiness\\n                    that exist alongside the negative ingredients such as war, sexism, social\\n                    injustice, racial discrimination, economic inequality, and hunger and\\n                    starvation. It is important that we be aware of these ugly, dangerous things in\\n                    the world, so that we can begin to improve the situation. But if, day after day,\\n                    we are only in contact with our anxieties and our anger about what is ugly and\\n                    corrupt, we will lose our joy and our ability to serve others. That is why we\\n                    have to be in contact with the peaceful and positive aspects in and around us\\n                    and be able to enjoy them. We need to teach our children how to appreciate these\\n                    wondrous and precious things. If we know how to appreciate them, we will know\\n                    how to protect them. This basic practice will protect our happiness and our\\n                    children\\'s happiness as well.</p>\\n                <p>There are many people who, although they know in theory that a flower is a\\n                    wonderful thing, are unable to be in contact with it, because the sorrow in\\n                    their hearts has closed them off. In the past, they may not have allowed\\n                    themselves to be in contact with the refreshing, healthy seeds in their\\n                    consciousness, and as a result, they are now cut off from them. The seventh\\n                    precept of the Order of Interbeing reminds us to practice conscious breathing in\\n                    order to stay in contact with the many healing and refreshing elements which are\\n                    already around us. At times we may need the support of a friend to help us get\\n                    back in touch with what is wonderful in life. \"A meal needs soup as the practice\\n                    needs friends\" is a Vietnamese proverb about the importance of practicing with\\n                    friends. Such a community of friends and fellow practitioners is called a\\n                    Sangha. On the path of practice we need the support of this community, and so we\\n                    say, \"I take refuge in the Sangha.\"</p>\\n                <p>Having one calm, joyful friend who is balanced and can understand and support us\\n                    in times of difficulty is a great fortune. When we feel helpless, depressed, and\\n                    discouraged, we can go to that friend, and, sitting with him, we can reestablish\\n                    our equilibrium and once again be able to contact the flower and the other\\n                    wonderful, refreshing things that exist within us and around us. If we receive\\n                    the benefits of the joy that our friend brings us, we can refresh the seeds of\\n                    healing in us that have become weak because they have not been cared for or\\n                    watered for a long time.</p>\\n                <p>The seeds of understanding, love, peace, joy, and liberation need to be sown and\\n                    watered constantly by living our daily lives in mindfulness. The Sutra on the\\n                    Four Establishments of Mindfulness offers many exercises for living in\\n                    mindfulness. By the process of conscious breathing, smiling, walking meditation,\\n                    sitting meditation, by our way of looking, listening and mindfully observing, we\\n                    help the seeds of happiness flourish. The realms of love, compassion, joy, and\\n                    letting go are the realms of true joy and happiness. If we have joy and can let\\n                    go, we can share happiness with others and reduce their sorrows and anxieties.</p>\\n            </section>\\n            <!-- section level 3 exercise -->\\n        </section>\\n        <!-- section level 2 exercise group for objects of mind -->\\n    </section>\\n    \\n\\nProvide a pure plain text output of (query, text) pairs as a Python list of tuples. \\nDo not include any Python code syntax such as python, triple backticks, or queries =. \\nOnly return the list content, with each pair in the form (query, text) as a tuple, in a clean text format.\\nFor example: [(text, text), (text, text), ...]\\n'}],\n",

All Four\\n                Establishments of Mindfulness—body, feelings, mind, and dharmas—are\\n                objects of mind. Since mind and objects of mind are one, in observing its objects,\\n                mind is essentially observing mind. The word dharma in Buddhism is understood to\\n                mean the object of the mind and the content of the mind. Dharmas are classified as\\n                one of the Twelve Realms (Sanskrit: ayatana). The first six of these realms are the\\n                sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The remaining six are form,\\n                sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharmas. Dharmas are the object of the mind, as\\n                sounds are the object of the ears. The object of cognition and the subject of\\n                cognition do not exist independently of each other. Everything that exists has to\\n                arise in the mind. The culminating phase of the development of this principle is\\n                expressed in the phrase, \"All is just mind. All phenomena are just consciousness,\"\\n                which means, \"Because of mind, all can exist. Because of consciousness, all\\n                phenomena can exist.\" This is developed in the Vijñaptimatra school of Mahayana\\n                Buddhism.</p>\\n            <p>In the Southern traditions of Buddhism, the idea of mind as the source of all dharmas\\n                is also very clear. The term cittasamutthana (mind-arising) and the term cittaja\\n                (mind-born) are often used in the Pali Abhidhamma writings. In the Patthana\\n                (equivalent to the Sanskrit Mahapakarana), the phrase cittam samutthanam ca rupanam\\n                (\"and mind is the arising point of forms\") is found.</p>\\n            <p>The object of our mindful observation can be our breath or our toe (physiological), a\\n                feeling or a perception (psychological), or a form (physical). Whether the\\n                phenomenon we observe is physiological, psychological, or physical, we know that it\\n                is not separate from our mind and is of one substance with our mind. Mind can be\\n                understood as individual mind and as collective mind. The Vijñanavada teachings\\n                make this very clear. We need to avoid thinking that the object we are observing is\\n                independent of our mind. We have to remember that it is manifested from our\\n                individual and collective consciousnesses. We observe the object of our mind in the\\n                way the right hand takes hold of the left hand. Your right hand is you and your left\\n                hand is also you. So the hand is taking hold of itself to become one with itself.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"principle\">\\n            <title>BE ONE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBSERVATION</title>\\n            <p>The subject of observation is our mindfulness, which also emanates from the mind.\\n                Mindfulness has the function of illuminating and transforming. When our breathing,\\n                for example, is the object of our mindfulness, it becomes conscious breathing.\\n                Mindfulness shines its light on our breathing, transforms the forgetfulness in it\\n                into mindfulness, and gives it a calming and healing quality. Our body and our\\n                feelings are also illuminated and transformed under the light of mindfulness.</p>\\n            <p>Mindfulness is the observing mind, but it does not stand outside of the object of\\n                observation. It goes right into the object and becomes one with it. Because the\\n                nature of the observing mind is mindfulness, the observing mind does not lose itself\\n                in the object but transforms it by illuminating it, just as the penetrating light of\\n                the sun transforms trees and plants.</p>\\n            <p>If we want to see and understand, we have to penetrate and become one with the\\n                object. If we stand outside of it in order to observe it, we cannot really see and\\n                understand it. The work of observation is the work of penetrating and transforming.\\n                That is why the sutra says, \"observing the body in the body, observing the feelings\\n                in the feelings, observing the mind in the mind, observing dharmas in dharmas.\" The\\n                description is very clear. The deeply observing mind is not merely an observer but a\\n                participant. Only when the observer is a participant can there be transformation.</p>\\n            <p>In the practice called bare observation, mindfulness has already begun to influence\\n                the object of consciousness. When we call an in-breath an in-breath, the existence\\n                of our breath becomes very clear. Mindfulness has already penetrated our breathing.\\n                If we continue in our mindful observation, there will no longer be a duality between\\n                observer and observed. Mindfulness and breath are one. We and our breath are one. If\\n                our breath is calm, we are calm. Our breathing calms our body and our feelings. This\\n                is the method taught in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the\\n                Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing.</p>\\n            <p>If our mind is consumed by a sense desire or by what we are observing, mindfulness is\\n                not present. Conscious breathing nourishes mindfulness, and mindfulness gives rise\\n                to conscious breathing. When mindfulness is present, we have nothing to fear. The\\n                object of our observation becomes vivid, and its source, origin, and true nature\\n                become evident. That is how it will be transformed. It no longer has the effect of\\n                binding us.</p>\\n            <p>When the object of our mindful observation is totally clear, the mind that is\\n                observing is also fully revealed in great clarity.To see dharmas clearly is to see\\n                the mind clearly. When dharmas reveal themselves in their true nature, then the mind\\n                has the nature of the highest understanding. The subject and the object of cognition\\n                are not separate.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"principle\">\\n            <title>TRUE MIND AND DELUDED MIND ARE ONE</title>\\n            <p>\"True mind\" and \"deluded mind\" are two aspects of the mind. Both arise from the mind.\\n                Deluded mind is the forgetful and dispersed mind, which arises from forgetfulness.\\n                The basis of true mind is awakened understanding, arising from mindfulness. Mindful\\n                observation brings out the light which exists in true mind, so that life can be\\n                revealed in its reality. In that light, confusion becomes understanding, wrong views\\n                become right views, mirages become reality, and deluded mind becomes true mind. Once\\n                mindful observation is born, it will penetrate the object of observation, illuminate\\n                it, and gradually reveal its true nature. The true mind arises from deluded mind.\\n                Things in their true nature and illusions are of the same basic substance. That is\\n                why practice is a matter of transforming deluded mind and not a matter of seeking\\n                for a true mind elsewhere. Just as the surface of a rough sea and that of the sea\\n                when it is calm are both manifestations of the same sea, true mind could not exist\\n                if there were no deluded mind. In the teaching on the Three Doors to Liberation\\n                (Pali: vimokkha-mukha), aimlessness (Sanskrit: apranihita) is the foundation for\\n                realization. What is meant by aimlessness is that we do not seek after an object\\n                outside of ourselves. In Mahayana Buddhism, the teaching of nonattainment is the\\n                highest expression of the oneness of true mind and deluded mind.</p>\\n            <p>If the rose is on its way to becoming garbage, then the garbage is also on its way to\\n                becoming a rose. She who observes discerningly will see the nondual character of the\\n                rose and the garbage. She will be able to see that there is garbage in the rose and\\n                that there are roses in the garbage. She will know that the rose needs the garbage\\n                for its existence, and the garbage needs the rose, because it is the rose that\\n                becomes garbage. Therefore, she will know how to accept the garbage in order to\\n                transform it into roses and will not be afraid when she sees the rose wither and\\n                turn into garbage. This is the principle of nonduality. If true mind (the rose) can\\n                be discovered in the raw material of deluded mind (the garbage), then we can also\\n                recognize true mind in the very substance of illusion, in the substance of birth and\\n                death.</p>\\n            <p>To be liberated is not to run away from or abandon the Five Skandhas of form,\\n                feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Even if our body is\\n                full of impurities and even if the world is of the nature of illusion, it does not\\n                mean that to be liberated we need to run away from our body or from the world. The\\n                world of liberation and awakened understanding comes directly from this body and\\n                this world. Once Right Understanding is realized, we transcend the discriminations\\n                between pure and impure and illusory and real objects of perception. If the gardener\\n                is able to see that the rose comes directly from the garbage, then the practitioner\\n                on the path of meditation can see that nirvana comes directly from birth and death,\\n                and she no longer runs away from birth and death or seeks after nirvana. \"The roots\\n                of affliction (Sanskrit: klesa) are the same as the awakened state. Nirvana and\\n                birth and death are illusory images in space.\" These quotations express deep insight\\n                into nonduality. The substance of this insight is equanimity or letting go\\n                (Sanskrit: upeksa), one of the Four Unlimited Minds.</p>\\n            <p>The Buddha taught very clearly that we should not be attached to being or nonbeing.\\n                Being means the desire realm. Nonbeing means the realm of nihilism. To be liberated\\n                is to be free from both.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"principle\">\\n            <title>THE WAY OF NO-CONFLICT</title>\\n            <p>The realization of nonduality naturally leads to the practice of offering joy, peace,\\n                and nonviolence. If the gardener knows how to deal with the organic garbage without\\n                conflict and discrimination, then the practitioner of meditation should also know\\n                how to deal with the Five Aggregates without conflict or discrimination. The Five\\n                Aggregates are the basis of suffering and confusion, but they are also the basis of\\n                peace, joy, and liberation. We should not have an attitude of attachment or aversion\\n                to the Five Aggregates. It is clearly stated in the sutra that the practitioner\\n                observes, having put aside every craving and every distaste for this life (Pali:\\n                vineyya loke abhijjha domanassam).</p>\\n            <p>Before realizing the awakened state, Siddhartha practiced austerities, repressing his\\n                body and his feelings. Methods such as these are violent in nature, and the results\\n                are only negative. After that period of practice, he changed and practiced\\n                nonviolence and no-conflict in relation to his body and his feelings.</p>\\n            <p>The method taught by the Buddha in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of\\n                Mindfulness clearly expresses the spirit of nonviolence and no-conflict. Mindfulness\\n                recognizes what is happening in the body and the mind and then continues to\\n                illuminate and observe the object deeply. During this practice, there is no craving\\n                for, running after, or repressing the object. This is the true meaning of the term\\n                bare observation. There is no coveting and no distaste. We know that our body and\\n                our feelings are ourselves and therefore we do not repress them, because to do so\\n                would be to repress ourselves. On the contrary, we accept our body and our feelings.\\n                Accepting does not mean craving. By accepting, we naturally reach a degree of peace\\n                and understanding. Peace and joy arise when we drop the discrimination between right\\n                and wrong; between the mind that observes and the body that is being observed (which\\n                we say is impure); between the mind that observes and the feelings that are being\\n                observed (which we say are painful).</p>\\n            <p>When we accept our body and our feelings, we treat them in an affectionate,\\n                nonviolent way. The Buddha taught us to practice mindfulness of physiological and\\n                psychological phenomena in order to observe them, not in order to suppress them.\\n                When we accept our body, make peace with it, and calm its functioning, not feeling\\n                aversion to it, we are following the teachings of the Buddha: \"Breathing in, I am\\n                aware of my whole body. Breathing out, I am calming the functions of my body.\"\\n                (Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing). In observation meditation, we do not\\n                turn ourselves into a battlefield with the good side fighting the bad. When we can\\n                see the nonduality of the rose and the garbage, the roots of affliction and the\\n                awakened mind, we are no longer afraid. We accept our afflictions, look after them\\n                as a mother looks after her child, and transform them.</p>\\n            <p>When we recognize the roots of affliction in us and become one with them, whether we\\n                are entrapped in them or not depends on our state of mind. When we are forgetful, we\\n                may be caught by our roots of affliction, and so we become our roots of affliction.\\n                When we are mindful, we can see our roots of affliction clearly and transform them.\\n                Therefore, it is essential to see our roots of affliction in mindfulness. As long as\\n                the lamp of mindfulness shines its light, the darkness is transformed. We need to\\n                nourish mindfulness in ourselves by the practices of conscious breathing, hearing\\n                the sound of a bell, reciting gathas, and many other skillful means.</p>\\n            <p>We need an attitude of kindness and nonviolence toward our body. We should not look\\n                on our body as only an instrument or mistreat it. When we are tired or in pain, our\\n                body is trying to tell us that it is not happy and at ease. The body has its own\\n                language. As practitioners of mindfulness, we should know what our body is saying to\\n                us. When we feel a lot of pain in our legs during sitting meditation, we should\\n                smile and change our position slowly and gently in mindfulness. There is nothing\\n                wrong with changing our position. It does not waste our time. As long as mindfulness\\n                is maintained, the work of meditation continues. We should not bully ourselves. When\\n                we push ourselves around like that, not only do we lose our peace of mind and our\\n                joy, but we also lose our mindfulness and concentration. We practice sitting\\n                meditation to have liberation, peace, and joy, not to become a hero who is capable\\n                of enduring a lot of pain.</p>\\n            <p>We also need a nonviolent attitude with regard to our feelings. Because we know that\\n                our feelings are ourselves, we do not neglect or overrule them. We embrace them\\n                affectionately in the arms of mindfulness, as a mother embraces her newborn child\\n                when it cries. A mother embraces the child with all her love for the child to feel\\n                comforted and stop crying. Mindfulness nourished by conscious breathing takes the\\n                feelings in its arms, becomes one with them, calms and transforms them.</p>\\n            <p>Before the Buddha attained full realization of the path, he tried various methods of\\n                using the mind to suppress the mind, and he failed. That is why he chose to practice\\n                in a nonviolent way. The Buddha recounted in the Mahasaccaka Sutra (Madhyama Agama\\n                36):</p>\\n            <p>I thought, why do I not grit my teeth, press my tongue against my palate, use my mind\\n                to overrule my mind, use my mind to repress my mind? Then, as a wrestler might take\\n                hold of the head or the shoulders of someone weaker than him, and, in order to\\n                restrain and coerce that person, he has to hold him down constantly without letting\\n                go for a moment, so I gritted my teeth, pressed my tongue against my palate, and\\n                used my mind to overrule and suppress my mind. As I did this, I was bathed in sweat.\\n                Although I was not lacking in strength, although I maintained mindfulness and did\\n                not fall from mindfulness, my body and my mind were not at peace, and I was worn out\\n                by these exhausting efforts. This practice caused other feelings of pain to arise in\\n                me besides the pain associated with the austerities, and I was not able to tame my\\n                mind.</p>\\n            <p>It is clear from this passage that the Buddha regarded this kind of practice as not\\n                useful. Yet, this passage was inserted into the Vitakkasanthana Sutra (Majjhima\\n                Nikaya 20), with the opposite meaning to what the Buddha intended:</p>\\n            <p>Just as a wrestler takes hold of the head or the shoulders of someone weaker than\\n                himself, restrains and coerces that person, and holds him down constantly, not\\n                letting go one moment, so a monk who meditates in order to stop all unwholesome\\n                thoughts of desire and aversion, when these thoughts continue to arise, should grit\\n                his teeth, press his tongue against his palate, and do his best to use his mind to\\n                beat down and defeat his mind.</p>\\n            <p>This same passage was inserted into the Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness\\n                which appears as the second version in this book (see Appendix): \"The practitioner\\n                who observes body as body closes his lips tightly or grits his teeth, presses his\\n                tongue against his palate, and uses his mind to restrain and to oppose his mind.\"\\n                This extract does not appear in most versions of the sutra (see the first and third\\n                versions), but is also found in the Kayasmrti Sutra (Madhyama Agama 81) whose\\n                content is very similar to that of our second version. The corresponding sutra in\\n                Pali is the Kayagatasati Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 119).</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"principle\">\\n            <title>OBSERVATION IS NOT INDOCTRINATION</title>\\n            <p>In Buddhist practice centers throughout the world, students are taught to recite such\\n                phrases as \"body is impure, feelings are suffering, mind is impermanent, dharmas are\\n                without self,\" as they observe the Four Establishments. I was taught in this way as\\n                a novice, and I always felt that it was a kind of brainwashing.</p>\\n            <p>The method of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is observing deeply in the\\n                spirit of \"not craving and not feeling distaste.\" Mindfulness does not cling, push\\n                away, reprimand, or repress, so that the true nature of all dharmas can reveal\\n                itself in the light of mindful observation. That the impermanent, selfless, and\\n                impure nature of all dharmas has the effect of causing suffering can be seen while\\n                we observe dharmas, but that is not because we repeat some formulas like the above,\\n                in an automatic way. When we look deeply and see the true nature of all dharmas,\\n                they will reveal themselves.</p>\\n            <p>When we mechanically repeat, \"Body is impure,\" we are reciting a dogma. If we observe\\n                all physiological phenomena and see their impure nature, this is not dogma. It is\\n                our experience. If, during our mindful observation, we see that phenomena are\\n                sometimes pure and sometimes impure, then that is our experience. If we look even\\n                more deeply and see that phenomena are neither pure nor impure, that they transcend\\n                the concepts of pure and impure, we discover what is taught in the Heart of the\\n                Prajñaparamita Sutra. This sutra also teaches us to resist all dogmatic\\n                attitudes. We should not force ourselves to see the body as impure or the feelings\\n                as suffering. Although there may be some truth in the sentences, just repeating them\\n                dogmatically has the effect of cramming us with knowledge. While we observe in\\n                mindfulness, we may see that we have many painful feelings, but we will also see\\n                that we have many joyful and peaceful feelings and many neutral feelings. And if we\\n                look more deeply, we will see that neutral feelings can become joyful feelings, and\\n                that suffering and happiness are interdependent. Suffering is, because happiness is;\\n                and happiness is, because suffering is. When we repeat, \"Mind is impermanent,\" our\\n                attitude is still dogmatic. If the mind is impermanent, then the body must be\\n                impermanent and the feelings too. The same is true of \"Dharmas are selfless.\" If\\n                dharmas are selfless, so are body, mind, and feelings.</p>\\n            <p>Therefore, the special teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of\\n                Mindfulness is to observe all dharmas but not to have any fixed ideas, just to keep\\n                on observing mindfully without comment, without assuming any attitude towards the\\n                object you are observing. In this way, the true nature of the object will be able to\\n                reveal itself in the light of mindful observation, and you will have insight into\\n                wonderful discoveries such as no-birth no-death, neither pure nor impure, neither\\n                increasing nor decreasing, interpenetration, and interbeing.</p>\\n        </section>\\n    </section> \\n\\nProvide a pure plain text output of (query, text) pairs as a Python list of tuples. \\nDo not include any Python code syntax such as python, triple backticks, or queries =. \\nOnly return the list content, with each pair in the form (query, text) as a tuple, in a clean text format.\\nFor example: [(text, text), (text, text), ...]\\n'}],\n",

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus,\\n            whoever practices the Four Establishments of Mindfulness for six, five, four, three, two\\n            years, or one year, or even six, five, four, three, two months, one month or half a\\n            month can also expect one of two fruits: either the highest understanding or the fruit\\n            of no-return. It may take seven years to attain the fruits of the practice, but people\\n            who have great willingness to practice don\\'t need seven years; it is enough to have half\\n            a month. That is why we say that this path of the Establishments of Mindfulness is the\\n            most wonderful path, which helps beings realize purification, transcend grief and\\n            sorrow, and destroy pain and anxiety. The bhikkhus were delighted to hear the teaching\\n            of the Buddha. They took it to heart and began to put it into practice.\"</p>\\n        <p>Mindfulness is the core of Buddhist practice. This practice can be done not only in\\n            sitting meditation but also in every minute of our daily life. When we are able to take\\n            hold of our body in mindfulness, we begin to master our mind, and our body and mind\\n            become one. If our practice of mindfulness is still weak, our body is like a wild\\n            buffalo. Mindfulness is the herdsman and our mind is the wild buffalo.</p>\\n        <p>The Ten Oxherding Paintings of the Zen tradition represent stages on the path of\\n            awakening, stages on the path of mastering the body and mind. In the beginning the\\n            trainer approaches the wild buffalo; trainer and buffalo are two separate entities. With\\n            the practice of mindfulness, the trainer comes to know the buffalo. Gradually, the\\n            trainer and the buffalo become one, and eventually the trainer is able to ride on the\\n            back of the buffalo, singing or playing the flute, and the buffalo can go wherever he\\n            likes.</p>\\n        <p>When we stand, walk, sit, lie down, or work in mindfulness, we are practicing what the\\n            Buddha taught us in the sutra. But in order for the practice to be easy and successful,\\n            it is very helpful to practice with a community, called a Sangha. The presence of those\\n            who practice mindful living is a great support and encouragement to us. Seeing people\\n            walking, sitting, being, and doing things in mindfulness, we are reminded to maintain\\n            mindfulness ourselves. In Buddhist communities, people use bells of mindfulness to\\n            remind one another to practice. The bell sounds from time to time and calls us back to\\n            being mindful. The presence of the people who practice around us is equivalent to the\\n            presence of several bells of mindfulness.</p>\\n        <p>With a Sangha, we get support whenever we need it, and we profit from the experience and\\n            insight of its members and also from their advice and guidance. A teacher is a treasure,\\n            but without a Sangha, the practice can still be difficult.</p>\\n        <p>Therefore getting in touch with an existing Sangha or setting up a small Sangha around us\\n            is a very important step. We should be able to participate from time to time in a\\n            retreat of five days or a week to practice mindfulness in a concentrated atmosphere.\\n            With friends we can organize from time to time a Day of Mindfulness to practice\\n            together. A Day of Mindfulness can also be organized in the family for all the adults\\n            and children to practice together. It is good if we can invite a number of friends to\\n            join us.</p>\\n        <p>Practicing Buddhist meditation is not a way of avoiding society or family life. The\\n            correct practice of mindfulness can help us bring peace, joy, and release both to\\n            ourselves and to our family and friends as well. Those who practice mindful living will\\n            inevitably transform themselves and their way of life. They will live a more simple life\\n            and will have more time to enjoy themselves, their friends, and their natural\\n            environment. They will have more time to offer joy to others and to alleviate their\\n            suffering. And when the time comes, they will die in peace. They will know that to die\\n            is to begin anew or just to continue with another form of life. When we live our life\\n            this way, every day is a Happy Birthday, a Happy Continuation Day.</p>\\n    </section>\\n    \\n\\nProvide a pure plain text output of (query, text) pairs as a Python list of tuples. \\nDo not include any Python code syntax such as python, triple backticks, or queries =. \\nOnly return the list content, with each pair in the form (query, text) as a tuple, in a clean text format.\\nFor example: [(text, text), (text, text), ...]\\n'}],\n",

But his teachings spread far beyond the area where that language was\\n                spoken, and there is no doubt that in the practice centers that lay beyond the\\n                alluvial plain of the Ganges River, the monks and nuns would have studied the Dharma\\n                in their own local languages. One day in the Jetavana monastery, two monks, Yamelu\\n                and Tekula, asked the Buddha if they could translate all his teachings into the\\n                classical meter of the Vedic language. They told the Buddha that they wanted to do\\n                so in order to protect the beauty and accuracy of the Dharma. But the Buddha did not\\n                want his teachings to become a precious object reserved for a scholarly elite. He\\n                wanted everyone to be able to study and practice the Dharma in her own language.</p>\\n            <p>About four months after the passing of the Buddha, the Venerable Mahakasyapa convened\\n                a council on Mount Saptaparnaguha at Rajgir in order to orally collate the Sutra and\\n                Vinaya Pitakas. Five hundred elder bhikkhus were invited to attend this Collation\\n                Council, which was sponsored by King Ajatasatru of Magadha. The language of the\\n                collation would naturally have been Ardhamagadhi, the language of the Buddha. If the\\n                local districts later developed versions in their own languages, these would have\\n                been based on the collation of the Rajgir Council.</p>\\n            <p>One hundred years later, a second council was convened in Vaisali to further collate\\n                the canon of the Buddha\\'s teachings. On this occasion, seven hundred bhikkhus were\\n                invited to attend. After the Second Council, in 375 BCE, the community of bhikkhus\\n                divided itself into two schools: the Sthavira, which tended to be conservative, and\\n                the Mahasanghika, which tended to promote development and reform. The followers of\\n                the Mahasanghika were more numerous. In the three hundred years that followed, many\\n                other schools branched off from these two schools. According to the\\n                Samayabhedoparacanacakra by Vasumitra, who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of\\n                the Northern tradition, there were eighteen schools in all.</p>\\n            <p>The number of schools proliferated because of the many different ways of\\n                understanding and commenting on the teachings of the Buddha. The works in which\\n                these explanations are contained are called the Abhidharma and belong to the Sastra\\n                Pitaka. Each school has handed down its own versions of the Vinaya, Sutra, and\\n                Sastra Pitakas. All three pitakas of the Theravada school are intact thanks to the\\n                relatively stable ground for practice in Sri Lanka. The Tripitaka of this school is\\n                written in the Pali language, which originated in western India. The Theravada arose\\n                from the Vibhajyavada, which was a school opposing the Sarvastivada.</p>\\n            <p>A third council was organized at Pataliputra under the patronage of King Asoka in 244\\n                BCE, two hundred thirty-six years after the passing of the Buddha. At that time,\\n                perhaps because King Asoka leaned more towards the Vibhajyavada sect, the\\n                Sarvastivadins moved to the north and established their base for development in\\n                Kashmir, where they flourished for more than one thousand years.</p>\\n            <p>Three versions of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness have come down\\n                to us. The main version presented in this book is a translation from the Pali\\n                Satipatthana Sutta (number 10 in the Majjhima Nikaya), a first century BCE scripture\\n                of the Theravada School. This version is exactly the same as the Pali\\n                Mahasatipatthana Sutta (number 20 in the Digha Nikaya), except that the latter has a\\n                little more text at the end. For purposes of this commentary, the Mahasatipatthana\\n                Sutta is regarded as version one.</p>\\n            <p>The second and third versions are from the Chinese Canon. The second version, the\\n                Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness, is a translation of the Nian Chu Jing\\n                (number 98 in the Madhyama Agama and number 26 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka) of\\n                the Sarvastivada school, translated into Chinese from the Sanskrit Smrtyupasthana\\n                Sutra. The third version, The One Way In Sutra, is a translation of the Yi Ru Dao\\n                Jing (Ekottara Agama, sutra number 125 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka). It comes\\n                from the Mahasanghika school, not in its original but in its later form.</p>\\n            <p>In the Chinese Canon, the name of the translator of the Sutra on the Four Grounds of\\n                Mindfulness is given as Gautama Sanghadeva. Master Sanghadeva came from what is now\\n                Afghanistan and traveled to China in the fourth century, living from the year 383 in\\n                the capital Chang An, and after that in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin. He\\n                began the work of translation between 391 and 398. He probably had learned Chinese\\n                when he lived in Chang An.</p>\\n            <p>The Chinese Canon also ascribes the translation of The One Way In Sutra to Gautama\\n                Sanghadeva. However, there are many reasons for thinking that the sutra was\\n                translated by the monk Dharmanandi. Master Dharmanandi was Khotanese. He traveled to\\n                China in the fourth century and took up residence in Chang An, where he translated\\n                sutras from 384-391. The book Marking the Era of Buddhism (K\\'ai Yuan Shi Pi Chiao\\n                Lu) says that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Sanghadeva. Master Tao An, in his\\n                introduction to The One Way In Sutra, says that it was Master Dharmanandi who read\\n                the original Sanskrit version for Zhu Fo Nian to translate into Chinese and for\\n                Gautama Sanghadeva to write down. After that, they brought the translated version to\\n                be examined by the translation school of Master Sanghadeva in Jian Kang, the capital\\n                of Dong Chin.</p>\\n            <p>The Li Tai San Pao Chi, Volume 7 (Sui Dynasty), the Ta T\\'ang Nei Tien Lu, and the Ta\\n                T\\'ang Ch\\'an Ting Chung Ching Mu Lu, all say that there were two translations of the\\n                Ekottara Agama, one by Master Dharmanandi and one by Master Sanghadeva. The books\\n                Ch\\'u San Tsang Chi Chi and the Chung Ching Mu Lu of the Sui Dynasty, and the Sutra\\n                Index of the T\\'ang Dynasty, all say that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Master\\n                Dharmanandi. Judging from all of this information and from the literary style of the\\n                text, we conclude that there was only one translation of the Ekottara Agama, the\\n                translation of Master Dharmanandi.</p>\\n            <p>The Mahasanghika school, which came into existence after the council at Vaisali,\\n                later divided into two branches, one going to the northwest and one to the south.\\n                There were five branches of Mahasanghika in the northwest, including the\\n                Lokottaravada, which was Mahayana in outlook. It was the Ekottara Agama of this\\n                branch, including the third version of the sutra on mindfulness presented in this\\n                book, that Dharmanandi translated. Therefore, our third version is more influenced\\n                by the Mahayana and can be said to be less close to the original teaching of the\\n                Buddha than the first two versions, because many later elements have infiltrated\\n                into it. Still, it contains the essence of the original teachings.</p>\\n        </section>\\n        <section level=\"2\" type=\"sutra\">\\n            <title>VERSION TWO: SUTRA ON THE FOUR GROUNDS OF MINDFULNESS</title>\\n            <sutra-source>Nian Chu Jing (Sarvastivada) from Madhya Agama (number 26 in Taisho\\n                Revised Tripitaka).

This is how the\\n                    practitioner\\n                    meditates on the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p>\\n                <p>\"Further, bhikkhus, with the passing of thought and the constant practice of\\n                    letting\\n                    go of applied thought, he enjoys for himself that state which the holy ones long\\n                    for, where mindfulness in letting go is fully purified, and he enters the third\\n                    dhyana. This is how the practitioner meditates on the objects of mind in the\\n                    objects\\n                    of mind.</p>\\n                <p>\"Further, bhikkhus, with the absence of joy, when anxiety about joy and elation\\n                    as\\n                    well as pleasure and pain are no longer, and his mindfulness in letting go is\\n                    fully\\n                    purified, he enters the fourth dhyana, and that is to meditate on the objects of\\n                    mind in the objects of mind. He meditates on the arising of dharmas and the\\n                    passing\\n                    of dharmas in order to arrive at peace and joy. He realizes right mindfulness in\\n                    the\\n                    present moment. He is able to see, know, and abandon dispersion. He is no longer\\n                    dependent on anything. He does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because\\n                    he\\n                    does not have worldly thoughts, he is not afraid.

The third version says that the\\n                sutra was delivered in Jetavana Monastery in Sravasti.</p>\\n            <p>In this section, all three versions use the term, \"ekayana\" (the One Vehicle). The\\n                third version uses this term in the title of the sutra. The first and second\\n                versions use the term, \"nian chu\" (Establishments of Mindfulness) in the title.</p>\\n            <p>A literal translation of the first sentence following the description of the location\\n                in the first version of the sutra would say, \"This one way, O bhikkhus, is the way\"\\n                or \"This only way, O bhikkhus, is the way.\" (ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggam). The\\n                second version says, \"O bhikkhus, there is a way.\" The third version says, \"There is\\n                the \\'one way in.\\' Why should it be called \\'one way?\\' Because it refers to our\\n                single-mind concentration.\"</p>\\n            <p>The first section of the first version is short and concise. The second version adds\\n                that all the Tathagatas of the three times, thanks to their practice of the Four\\n                Establishments of Mindfulness, were able to overcome the Five Obstacles and realize\\n                the path. The third version also mentions the Five Obstacles and says what they are.\\n                It also says that the Noble Eightfold Path is a path for practicing the Four\\n                Establishments of Mindfulness. In The One Way In Sutra, the Four Establishments of\\n                Mindfulness are called the \"Four Practices to Stop and Concentrate the Mind.\" As\\n                previously discussed, there is some question whether the translator of the third\\n                version is Gautama Sanghadeva or Dharmanandi. If the translator had been Sanghadeva,\\n                it is likely he would have used the term \"Four Establishments of Mindfulness,\" as he\\n                did in version two.</p>\\n            <p>II.</p>\\n            <p>This section expounds the ways of observing the body in the body. In the first\\n                version, six ways of observing the body are taught:</p>\\n            <canonical-list>\\n                <list>\\n                    <item>1. Observing the breathing</item>\\n                    <item>2. Observing the positions of the body</item>\\n                    <item>3. Observing movements and functions of the body</item>\\n                    <item>4. Observing the parts of the body</item>\\n                    <item>5. Observing the elements in the body</item>\\n                    <item>6. Observing a corpse</item>\\n                </list>\\n            </canonical-list>\\n            <p>In the second version, these six ways of observing the body are also taught, but\\n                breathing is offered third following the positions and functions of the body. In the\\n                observation of a corpse, only five parts are given to this observation instead of\\n                the nine in the first version.</p>\\n            <p>The third version teaches only three ways of observing the body. It does not include\\n                observing the breathing, the positions, or the functions of the body. There are\\n                eight parts to the meditation on observing a corpse.</p>\\n            <p>The unique feature of the second version is that, after the six teachings on how to\\n                observe the movements and functions of the body, there is a section that deals with\\n                unwholesome thoughts. This section has two parts: how to use a wholesome mind to\\n                deal with an unwholesome mind and how to use the mind to restrain the mind, like a\\n                strong wrestler holding down a weak man. Both of these ideas come from\\n                Vitakkasanthana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 20). We can say with certainty that this part\\n                was added at a later date, and in fact was added in an inappropriate place in the\\n                sutra, because at this point, the Buddha is discussing the practice of observing the\\n                body in the body and has not yet reached the Establishment of Mind.</p>\\n            <p>Other differences in the second version are teachings on the kind of concentration\\n                that gives birth to joy and happiness, which is equivalent to the first jhana, and a\\n                concentration that abandons joy but maintains happiness, which is equivalent to the\\n                second jhana, as well as meditations on purity, clear light, and signs. All this is\\n                evidence that the practice of the Four Jhanas had already begun to infiltrate the\\n                Sutra Pitaka, although discreetly. By the time of the third version, the practice of\\n                the jhanas is mentioned quite openly, by name. The meditation which observes the\\n                clear light can be seen as announcing the first steps in the formation of Pure Land\\n                Buddhism, and the meditation on the sign will be developed in the use of the kasina,\\n                a symbolic image visualized as a point of concentration.</p>\\n            <p>When it comes to the section that teaches observing mindfully the different elements\\n                which constitute the body, the second version mentions six elements as opposed to\\n                the usual four elements of the first and third versions. The six elements are earth,\\n                water, air, fire, emptiness, and consciousness.</p>\\n            <p>The third version has an additional practice that is the observation of impure\\n                elements pouring out from the apertures of the body (not as a part of the Nine\\n                Contemplations of the corpse).</p>\\n            <p>In the third version, the phrase most often repeated is, \"to arrive at peace and\\n                joy.\" The equivalent phrases most repeated in the first and second versions are as\\n                follows:</p>\\n            <p>Version One:</p>\\n            <p>This is how a practitioner observes the body in the body. He observes the body from\\n                within or from without, or from both within and without. He observes the process of\\n                coming-to-be in the body or the process of dissolution in the body or both the\\n                process of coming-to-be and the process of dissolution. Or he is mindful of the\\n                fact, \\'There is a body here,\\' until understanding and full awareness come about. He\\n                maintains the observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration. That is\\n                how to practice observation of the body in the body.</p>\\n            <p>Version Two:</p>\\n            <p>This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and\\n                outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight,\\n                clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as body.</p>\\n            <p>These paragraphs are repeated in the sections of the sutra teaching observation of\\n                the feelings, the mind, and the dharmas, substituting the words feelings, mind, or\\n                dharmas for the word body. If we are bothered by questions such as \"How can there be\\n                an inside of the feelings or an outside of the feelings?\" when we read, \"mindfully\\n                observing the feelings in the feelings, observation of the feelings from within or\\n                from without, or from both within and without,\" we must remember that repetition,\\n                though not always relevant, is a mark of oral transmission. The second version uses\\n                the phrase, \"observes the body as the body\" (Chinese: guan shen ru shen) instead of\\n                the phrase, \"observes the body in the body\" (Pali: kaye kayanupassana).</p>\\n            <p>III.</p>\\n            <p>This section concerns the practice of observing the feelings in the feelings.\\n                \"Feelings\" is the translation from the Pali vedana in the first version. In the\\n                second version the Chinese word used to translate vedana is jue, while in the third\\n                version the word used is tong. Why does the third version use tong instead of jue?\\n                The original meaning of tong is \"painful.\" Perhaps the translator had been strongly\\n                influenced by the doctrine that every single feeling is suffering. In this third\\n                section, the third version emphasizes that when there is a painful feeling, there\\n                cannot be a pleasant feeling, and when there is a pleasant feeling, there cannot be\\n                a painful feeling. It also emphasizes the necessity of observing mindfully the\\n                arising and disappearing of feelings and knowing their source in order not to be\\n                imprisoned in them or afraid of them. This is a positive point in the third version.</p>\\n            <p>The following is a quotation from the third version: \"Because he is not afraid, he is\\n                able to realize nirvana. Birth and death are no more, the holy life has been\\n                realized, what needs to be done has been done, there will be no more births.\" This\\n                quotation, which is not found in the first and second versions, appears three times\\n                in the third version. It is a sentence that is found over and over again in the\\n                sutras and most probably during the course of oral transmission it was added here.</p>\\n            <p>IV.</p>\\n            <p>This section deals with observing the mind in the mind. The third version does not\\n                mention mindfulness of the process of the arising and disappearing of psychological\\n                phenomena as do the first and second versions. In the third version, it is mentioned\\n                that we observe the dharmas that we can know, see, and observe as well as dharmas\\n                that we cannot observe. The word \"observe\" here has the meaning of practicing\\n                mindful observation. Observing dharmas which cannot be observed is a strange idea,\\n                equivalent to the teaching of the Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters, \"Our practice is the\\n                practice which is non-practice,\" which has a strong Mahayana flavor.</p>\\n            <p>An additional quotation of interest from the third version is: \"The practitioner does\\n                not rely on anything at all, does not give rise to thoughts of the world. Because\\n                there is no arising of such thoughts, there is no more fear. Because there is no\\n                more fear, no residue of the afflictions is left, and nirvana is realized.\" The\\n                latter part of this quotation is nearly equivalent to the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya\\n                Sutra: \"Having no obstacles, they overcome fear, liberating themselves forever from\\n                illusion and realizing perfect nirvana.\"</p>\\n            <p>V.</p>\\n            <p>This part deals with the practice of observing dharmas in dharmas. In the first\\n                version, we have the practices of observing the Five Obstacles, the Five Skandhas,\\n                the Twelve Realms of Sense Organs and Sense Objects, the Seven Factors of Awakening,\\n                and the Four Noble Truths. The first version (in its form in the Digha Nikaya)\\n                develops a teaching on the mindful observation of the Four Noble Truths and the\\n                Noble Eightfold Path, and this development is what gives it its name Maha (\"great\")\\n                Satipatthana. The second version only teaches mindful observation of the Twelve\\n                Realms, the Five Obstacles, and the Seven Factors of Awakening.</p>\\n            <p>The third version only teaches the Seven Factors of Awakening. (It has already dealt\\n                with the Five Obstacles in its first section.) Possibly because of carelessness on\\n                the part of the copyist, only six of the Seven Factors of Awakening are mentioned:\\n                mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, energy, joy, concentration, and equanimity.\\n                The third version teaches the Four Jhanas. The terms vitarka and vicara, usually\\n                translated as \"initial application\" and \"sustained attention\" are translated into\\n                Chinese as jue (\"perception\") and guan (\"observation\"). In this fifth section, the\\n                third version repeats the phrases we have already seen in the second and fourth\\n                sections and which have been compared with part of the Prajñaparamita Hrdaya\\n                Sutra, and adds some words that make it seem even closer to the Prajñaparamita.\\n                These words are equivalent to \"liberating themselves forever from illusion\" of the\\n                Prajñaparamita.</p>\\n            <p>VI.</p>\\n            <p>This section deals with the length of time the practitioner needs to realize the\\n                fruits of the practice, and it identifies what those fruits are. The first version\\n                says that the fruit known as the highest understanding can be reached in this very\\n                life, if the practitioner practices the Establishments of Mindfulness. The sutra\\n                says that practicing for seven years, five years, down to one month, and half a\\n                month, and, finally, seven days, can also result in the highest understanding.</p>\\n            <p>The second version goes farther, saying that to practice mindfulness for one day and\\n                night can lead to highest awakening, or that if we begin to practice in the morning,\\n                by the afternoon the practice will already have results. The third version does not\\n                mention the period of time necessary for realizing the fruits of the practice.</p>\\n        </section> <!--\\n        section level 2 Summary -->\\n    </section> \\n\\nProvide a pure plain text output of (query, text) pairs as a Python list of tuples. \\nDo not include any Python code syntax such as python, triple backticks, or queries =. \\nOnly return the list content, with each pair in the form (query, text) as a tuple, in a clean text format.\\nFor example: [(text, text), (text, text), ...]\\n'}]]"
