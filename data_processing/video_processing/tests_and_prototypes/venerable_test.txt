Namo Dukkha Bodhisattva Thich Khan Moni
Venerable Thien Tien, Venerable Thanh Nhi,
Venerable Dai Chung
Today is August 4th, 2024.
There are some interesting stories about meditation.
There was a client of a restaurant.
He went to the restaurant.
They served delicious food.
A table full of food.
He called the owner of the restaurant.
He asked him to taste the food.
The owner was very embarrassed.
Firstly, he was a regular customer.
Secondly, the chefs were the best.
They made delicious food.
Today, the owner is a close friend of the restaurant.
He calls the food everyday.
He likes it very much.
Why does he hide it like this?
The owner asked him.
Why are you not satisfied with the food?
Is it too salty?
No.
Is it because the presentation is not beautiful?
Is it because the presentation is not beautiful?
No.
Is it because the food does not bring you joy?
No.
Then why?
The owner said,
You should taste it.
There is no spoon to scoop the food.
There is no plate to taste the food.
Oh, I see.
I was very surprised.
I remember this because I was sitting in peace.
I saw that there was no machine here.
I remember the story very well.
For example,
We had prepared a gift for a very perfect gathering.
The food was full.
We were ready to contribute to the fun.
But the conditions to contribute to the fun,
to say the words of encouragement to enter the process of meditation,
we were not able to do this.
Just like we prepare delicious food,
the guests were also hungry.
There is a tool to taste the food,
which is a vaccine.
It is certain that the food is bad.
Of course, this is an exception.
Secondly, it is an exception that we use the Indian culture.
That is, if the food is put in the mouth,
we don't have to say anything.
But the Eastern culture,
the Western culture,
there is a spoon, a fork, a knife, a chopstick.
This sounds very funny.
But it gives us a look at the life of the gathering.
Sometimes we just ask for objects,
that is, external conditions,
to make it a joy,
to make it a happiness,
to make it a pleasure,
to make our life a pleasure.
But the thing we forget is that
all those external conditions are not factors
to make our life a pleasure,
our joy, or our happiness.
And the most important thing is the interior,
that is, the tools we use,
the goods we possess.
The conditions we have for our body and mind are important,
not the external factors.
That is, those objects are very wide,
including our family,
our home,
our relatives.
So it is full of conditions to make us happy.
But happiness does not come from external objects,
from the money we have a lot or a little,
from our relatives whether they are young or old,
from our relatives whether we love them or not,
from our children whether they are cute or not.
They are the ones that we have to worry about.
And the conditions to make you peaceful and happy
are the internal conditions.
According to Buddhism,
it depends on what your inner core is like,
what level your ability to nurture your mind is at.
You are in that situation,
you are in that condition,
but you enjoy life,
you enjoy life,
you become happy.
But if our inner core is confused,
uneasy, full of worries and worries,
then naturally what happens is that
no matter how beautiful the situation is,
even if you live in a luxurious house,
that is, in the wonderful conditions of the house,
in a peaceful and civilized country,
and in the arms of many people who love you,
but in your old life,
you are still unhappy,
you are still suffering,
you are still drowning in the word of Buddha,
you are still drowning, you are still going to hell.
Hell or not hell, heaven or not heaven,
happy or unhappy,
these are not unnecessary conditions,
but it is our inner ability.
So this inner ability
is not a gift that you receive from the Buddha.
You come to the centers of study,
no matter how good the monks and nuns are,
or the monks and nuns who are still alive and present here,
they still cannot give you
what makes up your inner content,
your collective power is created by yourself,
from the ability to receive the Buddha's teaching and collect it.
Therefore, full of happiness and contentment,
everything is waiting for us to enjoy,
but in our hands there is no vehicle,
no weapon,
there is only one thing,
starving to death in front of a full,
full of happiness and contentment.
I think this word, full of happiness and contentment,
sometimes sounds a bit strange.
It means the most luxurious food,
the most precious,
that is the first thing,
sent to let them have the experience
of the happiness of human life,
the contentment of life,
or the enjoyment of life.
These are not external conditions.
We all have similar conditions,
but can we enjoy them or not?
It depends on the nature of each human being,
whether they are mature or not,
mature,
mature,
raised,
whether they are poor,
rich,
young,
old,
in a monastery,
or in the middle of the city. you are still a person full of happiness
You don't have the inner condition
which means your inner content cannot be nurtured by the collective process
So even if you go to the Heaven,
you live in the Heaven, you are unhappy
This is the beginning
Let's talk to each other
This is the second thing
I have a habit of talking about the first, second, and third things
5 or 3 things and that's it
This is the second thing
I would like to say that the growth of a mind
is a long process of nurturing and development
It is not a gift from anyone
I would like to say that in this life,
parents don't give us a gift to grow our mind
We live a life of material things,
eating, drinking, and so on
We don't give them the growth of our mind
The growth of the mind can be from the physical condition
from the good nurturing of the people around us
But there are 3 kinds of growth that no one gives
There is no material thing that can nurture us to grow
For example, the growth of love
It is a natural need of every human being
Because we cannot live without love
We need the love of our loved ones
We need the nurturing of our loved ones
Therefore, love is a gift from God
that we receive from the beginning
But to nurture it to grow in the year
to be mature
is not as simple as
we are born to live like a normal human being
that can grow with love
In a very natural way,
the growth of love means that
when we were young, we only knew
that we loved the people who contacted us
and gave us a warm and full life
such as loving our parents, brothers and sisters
the flesh-eating people
So the growth of love
with the years we grew up
is to see that
besides the people who love us
bring us to life
nurture us to grow
and protect our life
there are other kinds of love
that are not personal
that are not direct
but they are very important
That is the love of understanding
Those are the people in this normal society
Those are the people who contact us
in many problems, many jobs
such as going to work
There are friends
There are employers
And this love
has a strange principle
that if it is limited
it will make you confused,
uneasy, and worried
Then it expands
When it comes to many people
the gift is complete
which means it returns to you
That is the mindset of how mature you are
and how wide your love is
Then the thing that goes back
is how much warmth it becomes
Imagine that a person
has a very narrow mindset
They only know their relatives
and acquaintances
One thing is that
in the way they behave
they cannot be friendly to anyone
In other words
they are difficult
Because to them
everyone is strange
everyone is difficult
They are difficult to talk to
They cannot be contacted
They cannot communicate
This kind of person
has a narrow mindset
They are two-faced
They are full of doubts
They have many worries
They are four-faced
Such people lead to
failure in life
That is for sure
Look at the people
who are successful in life
who are successful in life
They are friendly
They are easy to get in touch with
They are easy to connect with
They are friendly
They are easy to meet
They are easy to get close to
They are easy to get close to
So how much love
becomes how much success
in life
How much warmth
and happiness
and how much love
They are successful
in politics
in business
They are successful
in business
They are successful
in tourism
They are successful
in the temple
They are successful
in the temple
Because they just
stepped into the temple
and they have become
100 or 200 people in that community
and they have become
100 or 200 people in that community
Such an open-minded
Any field is successful
Such an open-minded
Any field is successful
People like this
They are willing to
get married
They are willing to get married
They are willing to get married
That is also the case
Their mindsets are broad
There are no provocations
There are no fibvers
Living with open-minded
Living with open-minded
With open-minded
With open-minded
camera
They become
B and confidant
or in other words
They become
Balamarks
Balamarks
It's very easy
This is the first development of every life
The first step is to develop love
The first step is to develop love
But it's not enough
Because this love
Because this love
Ladies and gentlemen
If it is nourished by wisdom, maturity
If it is nourished by wisdom, maturity
Then this love will lead to the direction of the path of accumulation
Then this love will lead to the direction of the path of accumulation
In other words, if this love
In other words, if this love
In the direction of accumulation
Surely this love
It nurtures a very strong selfishness
It nurtures a very strong selfishness
It loves anyone
It loves anything
It wants that thing
It wants that thing
It wants that thing
to be mine
This is a kind of mature love
This is a kind of mature love
But it's coupled with a desire
But it's coupled with a desire
The love is very advanced
The love is very advanced
It leads to the compassion of life
It leads to the compassion of life
Everyone knows this
For example, in normal life
For example, in normal life
If you are a person of family
If you are a person of family
If you think that your spouse
If you think that your spouse
doesn't care about you,
they are not allowed
they are not allowed
to have sex with each other
can not
to have sex with anyone
can not
talk with anyone
but talk to me
And this is the weird
And this is the weird
in this life
It's an ill-omen
in this life
They are very selfish
They are very selfish
full of jealousy
and
they killed their loved ones
when they just
brought their loved ones home
This is a kind of love
that does not develop
on the basis of maturity
but it is a kind of development
on the basis of a baby
and the baby
is not intelligent enough
So they think that
my mother is as beautiful as my mother
My neighbor's mother
is not as beautiful
This is a kind of selfishness
It leads to the misery
of human life
So we use the word
when love does not have the intelligence
to pass
then that love
becomes a kind of
poison to kill people
to kill themselves
So the human intelligence
develops That is a natural weakness.
When the intellectual ability is developed to a certain level,
you will step into the spiritual life.
If the intellectual ability is still weak,
there is still a level where you cannot leave the previous step,
then that intellectual ability
will only strengthen you.
If this intellectual ability develops in line with love,
then of course it will happen to that person.
To know how to make the love of others expand.
There is a meaning that we put ourselves in other people,
to empathize with others.
In the words of the teachers here,
love and understanding will go hand in hand.
If we don't understand others,
don't empathize with others,
don't open our hearts to others,
then this is a kind of poison.
It will harm each other.
And this intellectual maturity,
in general, if it has not reached a high level,
you have not yet been able to look at a person with empathy,
then it is certain that in our life,
wherever we go,
whoever we touch,
whoever we care about,
whoever we love,
we all have the ability to love that person.
And we cannot help anything.
And I would like to say that we love others,
that is, we love ourselves.
Hurting others is hurting ourselves.
Therefore, the intellect reaches a certain level of development,
according to the path of developing the Dharma.
From the collection of merits,
you will have the opportunity to guide your love
to reach a broad level,
to reach a high level,
and it becomes happiness for ourselves,
happiness for others.
Therefore, the intellectual ability
is the foundation of every human life.
It is also the foundation for those who collect.
It becomes a precious gift.
But if we do not possess it,
do not nurture it,
it is certain that we will not be able to enjoy life.
We can only enjoy ordinary things.
And the gift that the Buddha has given us
is the seed of rebirth on this earth.
We were born with the material of love,
we cannot enjoy it.
And what is love now?
It is the foundation of life,
but it will become a poisonous drug to destroy our life.
There are many people on this earth.
They enjoy the gift of love,
but they turn love into poison
to destroy their own life,
their loved ones,
their families,
and their generations,
from hatred,
hatred,
hatred,
jealousy,
jealousy.
This is the first state.
If we do not have the intellectual ability,
we will destroy ourselves,
we will destroy the love
that everyone has.
I have an elderly friend.
One day, I met her.
She was very young,
although she was sick a lot,
although she was 80 years old.
But I could not imagine that she was still very young.
She looked like a 50-year-old girl.
But many people said that she was younger than that age.
I was surprised.
I asked her,
how could she be so young?
After many decades,
I met her as if I had met her 30 years ago.
She said,
nothing strange, Master.
Because I have love.
I was surprised.
With Vietnamese people,
with Vietnamese culture,
we have been married for several decades.
At the age of 80,
there is no ghost that dares to touch us,
whether we love or not.
Because if we take our debt,
we will have to pay for it.
But she said,
she said a lot of philosophical things.
I listened to her.
I admired her.
She said, Master,
there are very contradictory things
that only the elderly can learn, Master.
I asked, what is it?
She said,
I have a family since I was 20 years old.
But I don't know love, Master.
I live with my husband and my children,
but I don't know how to love.
I only know how to love
when I am sick and sick,
and old.
I thought the five months of my life,
when I was sick and old,
when I was sick and old,
love was blooming in me.
When love bloomed,
there was a problem.
The family life,
when I was young,
I didn't know anything.
So the Master was very strange.
He gave young people health,
he gave young people,
girls,
wealth,
they were rich,
but they didn't know how to love.
In the family life,
sometimes it was lust,
but not love.
So when we are old,
when we know how to love,
our health deteriorates
every day,
and we die.
It is a kind of paradox,
and it seems that people can't discover it.
When they discover it,
they step into it.
This is a kind of logic,
but it is the most practical
in life.
You can see that
in normal life,
on the social level,
it seems that
at a young age,
people are only involved in one thing.
It is marriage.
It is living together.
It is giving birth.
It is making money.
It is a life of competition
for material things,
because material things
are rich or not rich,
and material things are happy or not happy.
But it seems that
those things
are gilded,
so everyone thinks
that it is important.
Actually, the root of the problem,
the content of the problem,
is to bring love to each other
for those who can't give it to each other.
The worry about
rice, clothes, rice, money.
It has been a long time
since we have gone out together.
But the strange thing is
that people don't look at
the person they married
30 years ago,
50 years ago.
On the street,
they only look at the person
on the street,
the street, the wife, the friend.
This seems to be
a common feature
of all couples
I don't know
if it is true or not.
Because I don't have a family,
people say whatever they want.
Let me tell you a story
to prove this.
On a boat trip,
there was a teacher
who went with a group
of boys and girls,
boys, boys and girls.
When the boat stopped,
the boy ran down
to buy a bouquet
to give to his wife.
The girl smiled,
she was very happy.
Three times,
when the boat stopped,
he gave her three bouquets.
Then the teacher
wondered,
why was her husband
so arrogant?
He said,
Your husband loves you very much.
Then the teacher
smiled and said,
let me tell you the truth,
he is not your husband.
He said, why did you say that?
No husband is as crazy as him.
Only the lover
does this.
The only time he gave her a bouquet
was the last time she came home.
After that, there was a story
so I'm 100% sure
that the boy
was his lover, not his husband.
The girl
smiled and said, yes,
the teacher is right.
But we are about to end
the period of being close and loving each other.
The boy proposed to the girl.
The teacher
was not
a family man
in the past.
But from the experience
of observing life,
observing consciousness
and growing up in love,
he said,
if you believe him,
you will live a happy life.
If you don't believe him,
you will lose him.
What does it mean?
Never accept
the proposal of a crazy guy like him. you will become old, and if you accept it, you will become the owner of the shop
End the story of giving gifts, going to the temple, and so on
So five years later, the story happened that the old couple met again
the old couple who gave gifts and went to the temple
It turned out that the old couple were sleeping, and the husband was also sleeping
They were about to break up because life was so miserable
This story is not in the novel, but in our normal life
These things give us a conclusion that
if our life does not develop in the third direction, which is the spiritual direction
then the development of knowledge is one thing, and love is another
It is also very limited, because the wisdom of human beings, the ability to recognize human beings
It is a tool for you to explore, to live in the middle of life
to deal with life-giving Dharma
It is not a foundation to make everything out of knowledge, of love
Therefore, going to the third direction of development is the spiritual life of adults
Growing up day by day, food and clothes are the biggest gifts you make for your love
It does not become rotten, dead, and hurt, but does not own anything
And love is a wind, a wind that cools people
But if you put it in any place, it will die immediately
Wisdom is the same
Wisdom, if it is in the spiritual life, or in other words, in the collective life, makes it pass
Then this wisdom, if it is extremely open
It helps you to make love the closest possible, it does not become fragile
It does not become old, it does not become boring
The second help is to make your wisdom develop to a broad level, a deep level
Then you will see a lot of problems
The first thing is that you explore your own life, that is, your inner self
And when you have the spiritual life, you add two parts
That is our love, our wisdom, our knowledge, our knowledge
Certainly, the first joy comes when we naturally open our heart
Accepting people is very easy
And life is no longer a chain of days
Going back and forth
It is no longer the tiredness of May
It is no longer the days of emptiness
So the third development is the development of the spiritual life, it is very important
Thank you
I speak a little fast, I don't know if you can hear me
The third problem is the development of the spiritual life
In short, this is the foundation of all religions
The religions on this planet
Guide us to many paths
So that we can make our life without unhappiness
It does not cause sadness for ourselves and for others
Like Ketoism, Buddhism, Palamonism, Kinaism, etc.
A thousand religions on this planet
They all establish the basic foundation of how to make people happy
A human life is very short
There is not much
70 years, 80 years
If we don't meet any religion
If we don't follow any spiritual tradition
Our life will pass very quickly
For example, if you don't come to the centers of meditation
There will be a lot of distractions
At the beginning of the week, you prepare for 7 days of work to earn money
And 5 days, 6 days, depending on your working day
Earn money and spend money
Happiness is just around the corner
Then look deeper into the family life
The desire to be lost
It rises and you solve the desire to be lost
It goes down and rises again
And you find a way to solve other desires
That's all
Actually, if life is only this short
It seems a bit boring
Earning money and spending money is called happiness
A lot of people have money
The forest, the sea, the ocean
They are a thousand times richer than us
They are unhappy, they are angry
Find a little bit of lost desire
So that the lost desire
Loses and finds again
Creates a very inspiring feeling
It's like a blessing
It's beautiful, it's like that
It's called a happy life
It seems a bit of a waste
Then a life of 6 days, 7 days of work
Tired and tired
To get a day off on Saturday and Sunday
To lie down and relax
Or go out and have fun
It seems a waste of a lifetime
And a life of wandering is not very long
Living leisurely like this
70 years go by very quickly
If you look back
You will realize that 10 years have passed
There is no difference
10 years in a month
20 years in a month
And it's very easy to lose your life
If life is only this short
There are a lot of people
With a progressive mindset
They experience it
They see it as short
We live 30 years, 50 years
We just need to work
We have to go back
If you lose your joy, you find your joy
If you lose your shame, you find your shame
If you run out of money, you make money to spend
It's like
Life only stops there
And life goes on
Waiting for death to come
Why is it so unreasonable?
If from now on
There is nothing more
Just go back and forth
To wait for death
It's better than dying now
It's better than dying now
Why do we live so long?
That's why
These names have reached
A level of wisdom
They are smart enough
There is no way to open
There is no spiritual path to go
They commit suicide
In a gentle way
We thought
These names were crazy
But it's weird
Because they are so smart
They see the problems
That we live through
We just don't see it
Actually, our life
Is a kind of life
It goes on
It goes on like that
To wait for the end of the year
To end life
You try
Experience it
Is there a greater joy
Than the joy you used to live?
No
Is there a thought
That excites you
So that you can be happy
For a day?
No
It's just the life
Of those who come and go
It's just the joy
Of those who come and go
It's just the life
Of those who come and go
It's just the joy
Of those who come and go
It's just the joy
Look at it
As
We live week by week
Wait until the end of the week
To get money
Then prepare for the next week
To get more money
And so on
Day by day
To get to the end
Actually
These are practical problems
Not what we
Look at life
That's how it is
So the third problem
We talk to each other
When we come to
The spiritual life
Of the open religions
The first problem
Is that you
It doesn't matter which tradition you follow
That is
The foundation
Of your love
For our love It is nurtured by the Dharma, it is nurtured by kindness
It makes the love of you who have not yet become a Bodhisattva
It has the ability to make joy in life
We live a long life, a lifetime
As an example, I told you
An 80-year-old woman, when she had a lover
She crossed the doorstep of illness, death, old age
She was 30 years old
Just like that
A heart full of kindness and sincere love
It bloomed in their hearts
The first thing is that love is a gift
They give it to people, not that they are full of negativity
I repeat
Right at the beginning of a life
We are possessing love
In order to be nurtured by mature love
This kind of love
It is empty of a mind
Owned by ordinary people
And if we are nurtured by a spiritual life
Love will develop to such an extent
Love that gives our love
Like a gift from the Buddha to the world
See it as the light of the sun
Spread the warm energy to this planet
Without asking for the perfection of this planet
And when a family life reaches such a state
In the love of each other
Or in the love of a couple
When they reach such a state
They can practice their mind like this
The first gift is to give to the one they love
A space, a free life
As it has been, as it has been
As the incense has the right to fly anywhere
So they make happiness for the one they love
Make happiness for themselves
Many years ago
There was a person
He was also a Buddha
He gave birth to a son
He was very well-behaved
He had a big loving family
And then what happened was
This son was very well-behaved
He was very well-educated
He was very successful
He had a good job
His salary was quite high
But because his body structure
Was not like the normal development
So instead of loving a girl
He loved a boy
This was not a problem for the westerners
The structure of the mind
Or the body of the mind
Developed in a certain direction
So he had the right to do so
There were even many states in the United States
That allowed the same-sex couples
To marry each other
But for the Vietnamese
The performance was very important
The house was very expensive
So they forced the boy
And in the end
The unhappiness was that
He could not live with the condition
That his father forced him
To leave the person he loved
He did not accept it
Even though he loved his son very much
But because of his stubbornness
He wrote a poem
And he jumped off the building
And he died
I want to tell you
When you have a spiritual life
To nurture your wisdom
Your love
You love but allow
The people close to you
The people you love
They live their own lives
They walk on their own feet
They develop their own feelings
So you do not hurt
The people you love
You hurt yourself
The pity for the mother
When her son died
You can imagine
She never cried
Every time she met the teachers
She cried bitterly
She said, why can I learn
A few things
From the teacher
He loved
He put his love
To become a gift
Not the stubbornness
For his performance
For his reputation
He wanted his son to follow him
If you can learn this
You can not make your son angry
He jumped off the building
From this
We can see
When you have a spiritual life
To nurture
Your love
Your love
When it grows
It gives happiness to people
When happiness comes to people
It is opposite to you
So the spiritual factor is very important
We just need to learn
A few things
From the teachers
Understand and love equally
Empathize with people
Put yourself in the other person
To empathize
And open your heart to people
You have made your spiritual ability
Grow
And great spiritual ability
It makes happiness
For those who have
In their mind
Love
And this
It makes happiness
For your children
Husband, wife, family
Parents
And the last thing
Of the spiritual life
When it grows
It makes
The preciousness of life
It is
When we
Go into a part of the practice
You have made
The fullness of life
Full of joy
Happiness
In this world
Why
When there is a spiritual factor
We make our life
Full of happiness
Generally
It is very natural
When we have
A basic practice
From the foundation of the practice
We just need to
Step into a door
It is a door
Observe, breathe, go in, go out
Then this thing is born
There is nothing more wonderful than
In the moments
When we are anxious
Or agitated
Or full of worries
We leave everything
It is natural
It does not mean
That we let the sadness
Overwhelm us
And we do something
Like the Buddha said
Instead of paying attention to the sadness
The joy, the worries
The worries remind us of those things
Then we pull our mind
It returns to the place
Observe, breathe, go in, go out
This is a practice
A very basic practice
Not only from the Master
He taught us
This practice was taught
26 centuries ago
To all the monks and nuns
If
There is a person
Who wants to practice
Wants to nurture the spiritual life
Wants to nurture the love
In the Vietnamese people
The Vietnamese people's wisdom
Then this practice
It is very effective
Right now, right now
To taste the taste of peace
Try to imagine
When our mind
It is full
It is angry
It is angry
It is full of hatred
Then we
Pull ourselves in
In a room of the Buddha
Sit quietly
In a corner of the room
Close the door
Don't let anyone enter
Into our private space
Sit and listen to our breath
Look at our breath
Listen to our emotion
Our anger
First
No need to go to the Dharma to practice anything
Observe the anger
It is destroying you
The anger is destroying you
The sadness, the hatred
It is destroying you
Observe your state of mind
Like this
The first time you face
These things
You realize that
It is like a mountain
That is crushing your heart
Then
When you realize
That you are suffering
That you are unhappy
You feel that
The way to save yourself
It is important
Not now
To find the one
Who makes you angry
It is important
Therefore, the first step
When you realize that
You are suffering
When you realize that
You are unhappy
When you realize that
You are unhappy
When you realize that
You are unhappy That is the physical illness that comes to the body
Headache, stomachache, etc.
We are looking for medicine
The practice method
for spiritual life
is no different
The first thing
The practice method
does not mean anything
It is a way for you to cure yourself
to get rid of the illness
of the mind
Actually
The physical illness
we know the treatment
but the mental illness
we don't know the treatment
Those people are
incompetent
They don't have the wisdom
The stronger word to call them
are the crazy people
who do that
The mental illness
The mental illness
The mental illness
The mental illness
They are screaming to death
We don't care about the treatment
We care about the people who do that
Only the crazy people do that
Only the crazy people do that
With a little bit of wisdom
We can do the natural treatment
for the mental illness
for the mental illness
Dear Master,
you can see that
the practice is not a problem
the practice is not a problem
Because of the reason of our love
Because of the reason of our disciples
Because of the reason of our practice
The practice is a problem
of the wise people
If you are wise, you can practice
to cure the mental illness
The mental illness
The mental illness
The mental illness
The mental illness
If you feel that
this illness kills you
but you like it
you don't need to do anything
you don't need to do anything
you don't need to do anything
you don't need to do anything
to make your life meaningful
to make your life meaningful
you don't need to say anything
The second thing
When you do this practice
The thousands of saints
and the old masters
are just like me
They have difficulties like this
They have difficulties like this
But the wise people
stop their mind
stop their mind
and let the breath go in and out
and let the breath go in and out
This is the first step of the spiritual life
and this first step
is a process
of reversing
the cycle of birth
of birth
Why?
First, when you are in the sad, joy, anger, and unhappiness
First, when you are in the sad, joy, anger, and unhappiness
your life will be unhappy
and you will die
and you will have a thousand deaths
But you reverse it
You don't want to stop your life
from being full of unhappiness
but you decide to stop
and change your life
to fill the other days
to live a happy life
to live a happy life
to live a happy life
to live a happy life
to live a happy life
to live a happy life
If you observe the breath going in and out
this is the first step
to nourish and live a spiritual life
The second thing that happens
when we start to go in this way
the natural effect
the natural achievement
What is it?
There will be a period
of sadness, joy, unhappiness
it comes and goes
It's their story
It's their life
But we are always in the state of mind
observing it
It comes, it goes, it lives, it dies
To reach this level of observation
it means that
in the old days, the Buddha called
the one who went into the realm of the saints
to start here
There is only one thing
that is
to enter the realm of happiness
not to be overwhelmed by unhappiness
by sadness, pain, ease
stuff like that
In ancient times they used the words
to enter, to renounce
to open the renowned eyes
or to go to the realm of the saints
They all have the same meaning
It means that when you don't accept
that you live a happy life
thats successful
yet you turn away
for unsatisfying
You live with the mind
observing every breath
and when you observe every breath
you observe
sadness, joy, pain
it comes and goes
as if it were
the guests outside
not you
Now in this normal life
we live in the middle of the city
we still go to work
like everyone else
we still make money
we still live day by day
and we don't run away from anyone
but now that person
is still yellow
humble
tall like a lotus flower
no one can touch him
no sadness, no joy
can touch me
no one can comfort me
when I am angry and uneasy
no anger or anger
because all of those
emotions come from within
they are all
observed by your mind
and when you see it
it becomes an object
it moves away from you
and disappears
so who has developed
a spiritual life from the beginning
can stop
can look at the breath
can look at the sadness, joy, pain
but not me
that person has the ability
to nurture their love
to become more mature
to be a gift of happiness
for themselves and their loved ones
who has entered
a spiritual life
start to go to practice
observe the breath
observe every thought
whether it is life or death
they will be able to observe
their consciousness
moving along
when they are born
naturally their mind
will develop more and more
to a higher level
this development
will nurture their conscious life
it will become a pure life
and it will become a life
full of joy and happiness
they will still go to work
6-7 days to earn money
like others
but all the boring work
of daily life
will become the joy of life
and all the daily life
will become the joy
when they do everything
such as cutting grass
cooking
cleaning
going back and forth
going home
but everything they do
will be nourished by their spiritual ability
it will be enlightened
it will be peaceful
it will not be empty
it will not be boring
it will not be going back and forth
everything will become new
everything will become
the joy
they will be able to enjoy this life
therefore, the spiritual life
when it is nurtured
naturally
there will be no more
worries
in short
maybe
when we just start to study
we still feel confused
but when we understand
that
the ancient gods
wanted to go to the spiritual path
to become the Buddha
the word Buddha
is very important
it means the wisdom of the gods
and the responsibility of the Buddha
they have to go to the spiritual path
by observing
by observing
to observe
all of your emotions
all of your joys
all of your sorrows
and all of your sufferings
and finally
they will be able to settle
in the heart of the observer
the observer
is non-self
the observer is the state
the observer is non-self
beyond the existence and non-self
beyond the physical space
beyond the life and death
of the human being
and finally
they will be able to settle
in the heart of the observer
from the path of meditation
the basic is
to try to go in
by observing the breath
observing the joy
you will feel the joy
at 11.15pm
at the right time
right here
thank you
