      ">>Because a number of texts, Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese, are cited throughout the commentary, we use the word sutra as if it were an English word and use the word sutta only when it is part of the proper name of a Pali sutta, such as Satipatthana Sutta or Anapanasati Sutta.\n",

      ">>In Chinese, the title of the sutra is Nian Chu.<<\n",
      ">>Nian is “to be mindful of,” “to put one’s attention to,” or “to remember.”<<\n",
      ">>Chu means either “the dwelling place” or “the act of dwelling,” “the act of being present,” “the act of establishing oneself.”<<\n",
      ">>Nian Chu therefore may be translated as “the Four Grounds of Mindfulness” or “the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.”\n",

      ">>Liberation and happiness are linked to each other; if there is liberation, there is happiness, and greater liberation brings greater happiness.<<\n",
      ">>If there is liberation, peace and joy exist in the present moment.<<\n",
      ">>We don’t need to wait ten or fifteen years to realize them.<<\n",
      ">>They’re available as soon as we begin the practice.<<\n",

      ">>To practice meditation is to look deeply in order to see into the essence of things.<<\n",
      ">>With insight and understanding we can realize liberation, peace, and joy.<<\n",
      ">>Our anger, anxiety, and fear are the ropes that bind us to suffering.<<\n",
      ">>If we want to be liberated from them, we need to observe their nature, which is ignorance, the lack of clear understanding.<<\n",
      ">>When we misunderstand a friend, we may become angry at him, and because of that, we may suffer.<<\n",
      ">>But when we look deeply into what has happened, we can end the misunderstanding.<<\n",
      ">>When we understand the other person and his situation, our suffering will disappear and peace and joy will arise.<<\n",
      ">>The first step is awareness of the object, and the second step is looking deeply at the object to shed light on it.<<\n",
      ">>Therefore, mindfulness means awareness and it also means looking deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<<\n",
      ">>The Pali word sati (Sanskrit: smrti) means “to stop,” and “to maintain awareness of the object.”<<\n",
      ">>The Pali word vipassana (Sanskrit: vipashyana) means “to go deeply into that object to observe it.”<<\n",
      ">>While we are fully aware of and observing deeply an object, the boundary between the subject who observes and the object being observed gradually dissolves, and the subject and object become one.<<\n",
      ">>This is the essence of meditation.<<\n",
      ">>Only when we penetrate an object and become one with it can we understand.<<\n",
      ">>It is not enough to stand outside and observe an object.<<\n",
      ">>That’s why the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness reminds us to be aware of the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mind in the mind, and the objects of mind in the objects of mind.\n",

      ">>Is there anyone who does not walk, stand, lie down, and sit every day?<<\n",
      ">>What is most important is to understand the fundamental basis of the practice and then apply it during our everyday lives, even if our lives are different from the way the Buddha and his monks and nuns lived twenty-five centuries ago.<<\n",

      ">>These are called the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.<<\n",
      ">>These four establishments, or foundations, are body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind.\n",

      ">>How can a grain of salt come to know this?<<\n",

      ">>The Buddha also proposed four exercises on mindful breathing for contemplation of the objects of mind in the objects of mind, so that we can penetrate, embrace, and look deeply into the object of our perception.<<\n",

      ">>Body is also an object of mind, feelings are also objects of our mind, and mental formations become objects of our mind.<<\n",
      ">>We can always inquire about the nature of our body, our feelings, or our mind, as well as our perceptions and other things.<<\n",
