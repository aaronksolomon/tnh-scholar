       "    'The word satipatthana (Sanskrit: smrityupasthana) is a compound of sati, which means “mindfulness” or “remembering,” and upatthana, which means “place of abiding,” “establishment,” or “application.” In Chinese, the title of the sutra is Nian Chu. Nian is “to be mindful of,” “to put one’s attention to,” or “to remember.” Chu means either “the dwelling place” or “the act of dwelling,” “the act of being present,” “the act of establishing oneself.” Nian Chu therefore may be translated as “the Four Grounds of Mindfulness” or “the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.”',\n",

Liberation and happiness are linked to each other; if there is liberation, there is happiness, and greater liberation brings greater happiness. If there is liberation, peace and joy exist in the present moment. We don’t need to wait ten or fifteen years to realize them. They’re available as soon as we begin the practice. However modest these elements may be, they form the basis for greater liberation, peace, and joy in the future.',\n",
       "    'To practice meditation is to look deeply in order to see into the essence of things. With insight and understanding we can realize liberation, peace, and joy. Our anger, anxiety, and fear are the ropes that bind us to suffering. If we want to be liberated from them, we need to observe their nature, which is ignorance, the lack of clear understanding. When we misunderstand a friend, we may become angry at him, and because of that, we may suffer. But when we look deeply into what has happened, we can end the misunderstanding. When we understand the other person and his situation, our suffering will disappear and peace and joy will arise. The first step is awareness of the object, and the second step is looking deeply at the object to shed light on it. Therefore, mindfulness means awareness and it also means looking deeply.',\n",
       "    'The Pali word sati (Sanskrit: smrti) means “to stop,” and “to maintain awareness of the object.” The Pali word vipassana (Sanskrit: vipashyana) means “to go deeply into that object to observe it.” While we are fully aware of and observing deeply an object, the boundary between the subject who observes and the object being observed gradually dissolves, and the subject and object become one. This is the essence of meditation. Only when we penetrate an object and become one with it can we understand. It is not enough to stand outside and observe an object. That’s why the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness reminds us to be aware of the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mind in the mind, and the objects of mind in the objects of mind.',\n",
       "    'The Buddha delivered the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness to an audience of monks and nuns, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. But that doesn’t mean that the practice of being mindful in the ground of the Four Establishments is limited to monks and nuns. Anyone can practice mindfulness. If monks and nuns can practice mindfulness in walking, standing, lying down, and sitting, then laymen and laywomen also can. Is there anyone who does not walk, stand, lie down, and sit every day? What is most important is to understand the fundamental basis of the practice and then apply it during our everyday lives, even if our lives are different from the way the Buddha and his monks and nuns lived twenty-five centuries ago. When reading the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, we have to read with the eyes of a person of today and discover appropriate ways to practice based on the teachings of the sutra.1',\n",
       "    'Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. There are four areas of mindfulness, four areas where mindfulness has to penetrate in order for us to be protected, for joy to be nourished, for pain to be transformed, and for insight to be obtained. These are called the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. These four establishments, or foundations, are body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind.',\n",
       "    'The First Establishment of Mindfulness is mindfulness of the body in the body. This means that when you bring mindfulness into your body, mindfulness becomes the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer. Mindfulness becomes the body, and the body becomes mindfulness. When mother embraces child, mother becomes child, and child becomes mother. In true meditation, the subject and the object of meditation no longer exist as separate entities; that distinction is removed. When you generate the energy of mindfulness and embrace your breathing and your body, that is mindfulness of the body in the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer, it is the body. The body becomes the object and the subject of mindfulness at the same time.',\n",
       "    'It’s like when nuclear scientists say that to understand an elementary particle and really enter into the world of the infinitely small, you have to become a participant and not an observer anymore. In India they use the example of a grain of salt that would like to know how salty the ocean is. How can a grain of salt come to know this? The only way is for it to jump into the ocean, and the understanding will be perfect; the separation between the object of understanding and the subject of understanding is no longer there. In our time, nuclear scientists have begun to see that. That is why they say that in order to really understand the world of the elementary particle, you have to stop being an observer, you have to become a participant.',\n",
       "    'The Second Establishment of Mindfulness is our feelings. The Third Establishment of Mindfulness is the mind, namely the mental formations. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha offered us four exercises of mindful breathing to take care of each of these fields of our mindfulness.',\n",
       "    'The Fourth Establishment of Mindfulness is the realm of perception. In the sutra it is spoken of as “the objects of mind,” and we can understand this as perception. The Buddha also proposed four exercises on mindful breathing for contemplation of the objects of mind in the objects of mind, so that we can penetrate, embrace, and look deeply into the object of our perception. Doing so gives us the insight that will liberate us from our delusion and our suffering.',\n",
       "    'Mountains, rivers, birds, the blue sky, houses, streams, children, animals—everything is the object of your perception. And we have four exercises of mindful breathing in order to help us inquire about the true nature of all these things, including ourselves. Body is also an object of mind, feelings are also objects of our mind, and mental formations become objects of our mind. We can always inquire about the nature of our body, our feelings, or our mind, as well as our perceptions and other things. If we look deeply at the body in the body, it becomes an object of the mind. When we are looking at feelings, then feelings are the object of mind. When we are observing mind, mind becomes the object of our mind. All the establishments of mindfulness are in fact objects of mind.',\n",
       "    'A monk once asked me how mind can be an object of mind. I said if we take our two fingers and rub them together, then the body is in touch with the body. The mind is the same. When we look into our body, our body is the object of our mind. When we look into form, form is the object of our mind. When we look into mental formations, mental formations are the object of our mind. So we see that the field of objects of mind is very vast. But the division into four establishments is a convenient tool to help us learn how to practice mindfulness.',\n",

In the establishment known as the feelings, the practitioner is fully aware of pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings as they arise, endure, and disappear. He is aware of feelings that have a psychological basis and feelings that have a physiological basis. In the establishment known as the mind, the practitioner is fully aware of states of mind such as desire, hatred, confusion, concentration, dispersion, internal formations, and liberation. In the establishment known as the objects of mind, the practitioner is fully aware of the Five Aggregates that comprise a person (form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness), the sense organs and their objects, the factors that can obstruct understanding and liberation, the factors that can lead to awakening, and the Four Noble Truths concerning suffering and the release from suffering.',\n",

Practicing in this way, our breathing becomes conscious breathing. This exercise is simple, yet its effects are profound. To succeed, we must put our whole mind into our breathing and nowhere else. As we follow our in-breath, for example, we need to be watchful of distracting thoughts. As soon as a thought such as, “I forgot to turn off the light in the kitchen,” arises, our breathing is no longer conscious breathing as we are thinking about something else. To succeed, our mind needs to stay focused on our breathing for the entire length of each breath. As we breathe, our mind is one with our breath, and we become one with our breath. That is the meaning of “mindfulness of the body in the body.”',\n",

If we continue to breathe consciously for ten breaths, without our mind going astray, then we have taken a valuable step on the path of practice. If we can practice conscious breathing for ten minutes, an important change will take place in us. How can a practice as simple as this bring about such important results and what are the results that it can bring about?',\n",
       "    'The first result of conscious breathing is returning to ourselves. In everyday life, we often get lost in forgetfulness. Our mind chases after thousands of things, and we rarely take the time to come back to ourselves. When we have been lost in forgetfulness like that for a long time, we lose touch with ourselves, and we feel alienated from ourselves. This phenomenon is very common in our times. Conscious breathing is a marvelous way to return to ourselves. When we are aware of our breath, we come back to ourselves as quick as a flash of lightning. Like a child who returns home after a long journey, we feel the warmth of our hearth, and we find ourselves again. Coming back to ourselves is already a remarkable success on the path of the practice.',\n",
       "    'The second result of conscious breathing is that we come in contact with life in the present moment, the only moment when we can touch life. The life in us and around us is wonderful and abundant. If we’re not free, we can’t be in contact with it, and we’re not really living our lives. We shouldn’t be imprisoned by regrets about the past, anxieties for the future, or attachment and aversion in the present.',\n",

When we follow our breathing, we are already at ease, no longer dominated by our anxieties and longings. As we breathe consciously, our breath becomes more regular, and peace and joy arise and become more stable with every moment. Relying on our breathing, we come back to ourselves and are able to restore the oneness of our body and mind. This integration allows us to be in real contact with what is happening in the present moment, which is the essence of life.'],\n",

       "    'Some practitioners and commentators, because they attach so much importance to the realization of the states of concentration (Pali: jhana; Sanskrit: dhyana) of the Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas, have explained the term “whole body” to mean the “whole breath body” and not the physical body of the practitioner. The Patisambhida Magga, Vimutti Magga, and Visuddhi Magga, all well-known commentaries, tell us to concentrate on the tip of our nose, the place where the air enters and goes out from the body, as we breathe. We are not told to follow our breath into our body, because the commentators fear that our body may be too large an object for us to concentrate on. This kind of reasoning has led the commentators to interpret the word “body” (kaya) in the sutra as “breath body.” But as we read the sutra, we see that the practice of being mindful of the whole “breath body” was already dealt with in the second exercise: “Breathing in a long breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing in a long breath.’ Breathing out a short breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’ ” Why then do we need to repeat this exercise?',\n",
       "    'The first four exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing (Anapanasati) teach us to focus our attention on the body, so it is natural for the third exercise in the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness (Satipatthana) also to focus on the full awareness of the physical body. Nowhere in either sutra are we taught to concentrate on the breath at the tip of the nose. Nowhere are we taught that we shouldn’t concentrate on the whole physical body.',\n",
       "    'In recent times, the Burmese meditation master Mahasi Sayadaw taught the method of being attentive to the inflation and contraction of the abdomen caused by the in-breath and the out-breath. Using this method, the practitioner can realize concentration easily, but it isn’t described by the Mahasi as a method of awareness of breathing. The basic reason for doing this practice, according to the Mahasi, is that understanding (prajña) arises naturally when there is concentration. Perhaps the reason Mahasi Sayadaw doesn’t describe this method as a practice of awareness of breathing is because of traditional prejudice that conscious breathing should not follow the breath into the body and down into the abdomen.',\n",
       "    'Here it may be useful to say something about the purpose of concentration. Right Concentration (samyak samadhi), one stage of the Noble Eightfold Path, leads to an awareness and deep observation of the object of concentration and eventually to awakened understanding. The Pali compound word samatha-vipassana (Sanskrit: samatha-vipashyana) means “stopping-observing,” “calming-illuminating,” or “concentrating-understanding.”',\n",
       "    'There are also states of concentration that encourage the practitioner to escape from the complexities of suffering and existence, rather than face them directly in order to transform them. These can be called “wrong concentration.” The Four Form Jhanas and the Four Formless Jhanas are states of meditational concentration which the Buddha practiced with teachers such as Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, and he rejected them as not leading to liberation from suffering. These states of concentration probably found their way back into the sutras around two hundred years after the Buddha passed into mahaparinirvana . The results of these concentrations are to hide reality from the practitioner, so we can assume that they shouldn’t be considered Right Concentration. To dwell in these concentrations for a duration of time for the sake of healing may be one thing, but to escape in them for a long time isn’t what the Buddha recommended.',\n",
       "    'In the third exercise, the practitioner uses her breathing to bring body and mind together as one, so the object of concentration is simultaneously body, mind, and breath. This condition, known as “oneness of body and mind,” is one of total integration. In our daily lives, we often find our mind and our body separated. Our body may be here, while our mind is somewhere else, perhaps lost in the distant past or floating in a distant future. Through mindfulness, we can realize the oneness of body and mind, and we’re able to restore the wholeness of ourselves. In this condition, every practice will take us back to the source, which is the oneness of body and mind, and we open to a real encounter with life.',\n",
       "    'When body and mind are one, the wounds in our hearts, minds, and bodies begin to heal. As long as there is separation between body and mind, these wounds can’t heal. During sitting meditation, the three elements of breath, body, and mind are calmed, and gradually they become one. When peace is established in one of the three elements, the other two will soon have peace also. For example, if the body is in a very stable position and all the muscles and the nervous system are relaxed, then the mind and breath are immediately influenced, and they too gradually become calmed. Similarly, if we practice conscious breathing in the right way, our breathing becomes more regular, calm, and harmonious with every moment, and this regularity, calmness, and harmony of the breathing will spread to our body and mind, and the body and mind will benefit from it. It’s only by these kinds of processes that the oneness of body and mind will be achieved. When there’s oneness of body and mind, the breathing serves as “harmonizer,” and we realize peace, joy, and ease, the first fruits of meditation practice.'],\n",

If we’re gasping for breath or if our breath is irregular, we can’t calm the functions of our body. So the first thing is to harmonize our breathing. Our in-breaths and out-breaths should flow smoothly and lightly. When our breath is harmonious, our body is also. Our breath needs to be light and even and not audible. It should flow smoothly, like a small stream of water running down fine sand into the ocean. The more subtle our breath is, the more peaceful our body and mind will be.

Feelings of peace and joy are the nourishment of the practitioner and help the practitioner go far on the path of practice. To learn more about this, you are encouraged to practice the fifth and sixth exercises of the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. These two exercises are designed to help the practitioner nourish herself with the joy of meditational concentration. The essence of meditation practice is to come back to dwell in the present moment and to observe what is happening in the present moment. “A wonderful moment” means that the practitioner can see the wonders of life in her body, mind, and breathing and can make the feelings of peace and happiness stable and strong.',\n",

As we already know, the peace of the body is the peace of the mind.',\n",
       "    'In exercises three and four, the practitioner follows the breath while returning to be one with the body and calming the whole of the body. Obviously, while practicing these breathing exercises, all your organs of sense perception—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—are closed off so that the images of the world around don’t come in and agitate the peace within. To return to the body in this way is also to return to the mind.',\n",

We may think, “Today is not my day.” At times like this, it’s best simply to return to our body, cut off all contact, and close the doors of the senses. Following our breathing, we can collect our mind, body, and breath, and they will become one. We will have a feeling of warmth, like someone sitting inside by a fireplace while the wind and rain are raging outside. This method can be practiced anywhere at any time, not just in the meditation hall. We come back in contact with ourselves and make ourselves whole again.',\n",
       "    'We shouldn’t think that to close the doors of the sense perceptions is to close ourselves off from life and the world, to sever our contact with life. When we’re not truly ourselves, when we’re divided and dispersed, we’re not really in contact with life. The contact is profound only when we are really ourselves. If we’re not ourselves in the present moment, when we look at the blue sky, we don’t really see the blue sky. When we hold the hand of a child, we aren’t really holding the hand of a child. When we drink tea, we’re not really drinking tea. Therefore, the wholeness of ourselves is the basis of any meaningful contact. We can realize the wholeness of ourselves by means of conscious breathing, which brings us back to our body and mind. Realizing the wholeness of ourselves is also to renew ourselves in every moment. We become fresh, and others enjoy being with us. When we renew ourselves, we see everything else as new. The Bamboo Forest Zen Master once said: “Everything I touch becomes new.”'],\n",

In addition to the conscious breathing, we can use the method of silently calling each part of the body by name to enable these parts to become increasingly clear in the light of mindfulness.',\n",

We often have the impression that we’re already totally in touch with our body, but often we’re wrong. Between us and our body there can be a large separation, and our body remains a stranger to us. Sometimes we hate our body. There are even people who see their body as a prison and a place of punishment. To come back to our body is to become familiar with it and to establish harmony with it.

Sometimes we observe just one part of the body deeply, such as our eyes, heart, or toe. In the process of observation from the head to the feet, some observations may spring up in our mind. For example, as we pass our heart, we may think, “My friend John has a heart condition. I must visit him soon to see if he’s all right.” We can note these observations and then continue with the work of observing the remaining parts of the body. Later we can return to those observations.'],\n",

When we observe the body this way, we are in direct contact with it, and we are able to see the process of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be in the constituents that comprise the body.

       "    'Observing the impermanent, selfless, and interdependent nature of all that is doesn’t lead us to feel aversion for life. On the contrary, it helps us see the preciousness of all that lives. Liberation doesn’t mean running away from or destroying life. Many people present Buddhism as a path that denies life, that transcends the world of the Five Aggregates (Sanskrit: skandha) of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. To present Buddhism in this way is no different from saying that the object of our practice is to arrive at the absence of life or nothingness.',\n",
       "    'In the Dhammacakka Sutta, the first Dharma talk given by the Buddha in the Deer Park, the Buddha taught that to be attached to existence (Sanskrit: bhava) is no worse than to be attached to nonexistence (Sanskrit: abhava). In the Kaccayana Gotta Sutta, the Buddha also taught that reality is not to be found in terms of existence or nonexistence. His meaning is perfectly clear: suffering is not brought about by life, the Five Skandhas, or the selfless and interdependent nature of all that is. The cause of ill-being is our ignorance. Because we’re not able to see that the true nature of life is impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence, we become attached to things, believing that they’re permanent. From this thinking arise the roots of affliction and the internal formations or knots: craving, hatred, pride, doubt, and so forth. Impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence are the essential conditions for life. Without impermanence, how can the corn seed become a corn plant and how can the baby grow up and go to school?',\n",
       "    'In fact, it’s because of impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence that things come into existence, mature, decay, and cease to be. Birth, decay, and ceasing to be are the necessary steps of the lives of all species. Presenting impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence as problematic, we senselessly make life unacceptable. We need to do the opposite; we need to praise them as essential elements of life. Only when we’re not able to recognize these attributes as they are do we get caught in the knots of attachment and sorrow.',\n",
       "    'The Ratnakuta Sutra gives the example of someone who throws a clod of earth at a dog. When the clod hits the dog, he runs after it and barks furiously at it. The dog doesn’t know that the thing responsible for his pain isn’t the clod of earth but the man who threw it. The sutra teaches:',\n",
       "    'Because we don’t understand correctly, we become attached to things, and then we’re caught by them. In the sutra, the term “aggregate” (Pali: khanda; Sanskrit: skandha) and the term “aggregate of clinging” (Pali: upadanakkhanda; Sanskrit: upadanaskandha) are used. Skandhas are the five elements that give rise to life, and the upadana skandhas are the five elements as objects of attachment. The root of suffering isn’t the skandhas but the attachment that binds us. There are people who, because of their incorrect understanding of what the root of suffering is, instead of dealing with their attitude of attachment, think they have to deal with their organs of sense and the aggregates, and so they fear form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and objects of mind and feel aversion for the body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.',\n",
       "    'The Buddha was someone who, because he wasn’t attached to things, lived in peace, joy, and freedom with a healthy and fresh vigor. He always had a smile on his lips, and his presence created a fresh atmosphere around him. There are many stories in the sutras which show how much the Buddha loved life and knew how to appreciate the beautiful things around him. On many occasions, he pointed out beautiful scenery to Ananda, such as the sun setting on Vulture Peak, the golden rice fields surrounded by green paths, the fresh green landscape of the Bamboo Forest Monastery, and the lovely town of Vaisali. The Buddha was not afraid of beautiful things, because he was able to see the impermanent nature of everything, beautiful or ugly. He didn’t chase after things, and he didn’t run away from them either. The way of freedom isn’t running away from the Five Aggregates, but coming face to face with them in order to understand their true nature.',\n",
       "    'If we cut flowers from our garden to place on the altar, that is because we acknowledge the beauty of those flowers. All we can say is, “Although these flowers are beautiful, their beauty is fragile. When, in a few days time, these flowers die, their beauty will die with them.” We understand this, and when the flowers wilt in a few days, we won’t suffer or feel sad. Because we can see the impermanent nature of the flowers, we can appreciate all the more the beauty of each flower. To observe the impermanence of things is not to reject them, but to be in contact with them with deep understanding, without being caught in desire and attachment.',\n",
       "    'Freedom in Buddhism is the freedom which comes about by being awake and understanding. A practitioner doesn’t need to struggle with desire. The two basic meditation sutras, the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness and the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, both shed light on this principle: “When his mind is desiring something, the practitioner is aware, ‘My mind is desiring’” (Satipatthana Sutta), and “Breathing in, I am aware of the functions of my mind” (Anapanasati Sutta). In identifying the mind of desire, in observing the nature of that mind and the nature of the object of desire, we’ll see the impermanence, selflessness, and interdependence of it, and we’ll no longer be dominated by that state of mind.',\n",
       "    'For many generations, some Buddhists have presented Buddhism as a path that destroys desire, and they have described liberated persons as emaciated arhats with wrinkled skin and no vitality. We should define what is meant by desire. If we’ve had nothing to eat for three days, we feel like eating. Is that desire? Is the natural desire for the indispensable elements of life a desire we need to destroy? To eat when hungry, to drink when thirsty, is that to go against the path which leads to emancipation? But if so, then Buddhism would be a path that flees from and destroys life.',\n",
       "    'We know very well that to eat and drink enough are necessary to nourish our body and keep us strong. We also know that eating and drinking excessively can destroy our bodies. So we can say that to eat and drink so that the body is strong and healthy is to walk on the path of emancipation, while to eat and drink in a way that causes our body and others to suffer is to go against the way of liberation. In the first case desire isn’t present, in the second case desire is present.',\n",
       "    'Other Buddhists have opposed the image of the emaciated arhat destroying desire and have described liberated persons as fresh, healthy bodhisattvas, beautiful to look at and full of vigor. The image of the bodhisattva is very close to the image of the Buddha entering life with a heart of love and compassion and a smile on his lips. Although the Buddha enjoyed the solitary life, he never refused to go deeply into the world in order to help living beings.',\n",
       "    'To know how to appreciate a beautiful sunset is not desire, if we “remain established in the observation, free and not caught up in any worldly consideration” (Satipatthana Sutta).

To swim in a cool stream, to drink a glass of clear water, to eat a sweet orange, and to know how to appreciate the coolness, the clarity, and the sweetness, is not desire if we are not attached to these things. In the Southern tradition of Buddhism, and to some extent in the Northern tradition, generations of Buddhists have expressed fear of peace and joy and have not dared to practice peace and joy.

Each of these feelings—pleasant, unpleasant, neutral—relies on all other feelings to be born, mature, and disappear. To observe the feelings is to sit on the bank of the river of feelings and identify each feeling as it is arises, matures, and disappears.',\n",
       "    'Our feelings usually play an important part in directing our thoughts and our mind. Our thoughts arise and become linked to each other around the feelings that are present. When we are mindful of our feeling, the situation begins to change. The feeling is no longer the only thing present in us, and it is transformed under the light of our awareness. Therefore, it no longer sweeps us along the way it did before there was mindfulness of the feeling. If we continue to observe the feeling mindfully, we will be able to see its substance and its roots. This empowers the observer. When we are able to see the nature of something, we are able to transcend it and not be led astray or corrupted by it anymore.'],\n",

In the Magandiya Sutra (Majjhima Nikaya 75), a man who is forced to live in the forest because he has leprosy, suffering from severe itching and stinging. He dug a hole, filled it with dry branches and logs, and set them on fire. When the fire became red-hot charcoal, he stood at the edge of the hole and stretched his arms and legs out over it to catch the heat. When he did this, his suffering was relieved. On days when he could not make a charcoal fire to warm himself, his itching was unbearable. Miraculously, some years later, he was cured of the disease and went back to live in the village.',\n",

The charcoal was extremely hot, he couldn’t go near it. If someone had dragged him to the hole to warm his body over the charcoal, his suffering would have been great. That which in former times had brought him happiness and relief was now a source of agony. The Buddha said, “Desire is also just a hole of burning charcoal in the forest. Only those who are sick look on desire as happiness.” Before he became a monk, the Buddha had tasted a life of trying to satisfy the five desires, so his words came from experience. True happiness, he said, is a life with few desires, few possessions, and the time to enjoy the many wonders in us and around us.',\n",
       "    'The scriptures record how the monk Baddhiya tasted happiness and ease when he observed his life of no desire. One night while sitting in meditation at the foot of a tree in the Bamboo Forest Monastery, Baddhiya suddenly twice called out the words, “O happiness!” The next morning, another bhikkhu reported this to the Buddha, thinking that the monk Baddhiya regretted losing the high position he had had when he was a governor. That afternoon after the Dharma talk, the Buddha summoned Baddhiya and asked, “Is it true that yesterday during your meditation you called out twice, ‘O happiness!’?” Baddhiya replied, “Venerable Sir, it is true that last night I called out twice, ‘O happiness!’”',\n",

Now as a bhikkhu, I go into the forest on my own, sit alone at the foot of a tree, sleep alone without a curtain or a mat, and I never have any feelings of unease or fear. I feel a great sense of ease, joy, and peace that I never felt when I was a governor. I do not fear assassins or thieves, because I have nothing to be stolen or fought over. I live at ease like a deer in the forest. During last night’s meditation, I felt clearly that feeling of ease, and that is why I raised my voice and called out twice, ‘O happiness!’ If I disturbed any of my fellow practitioners, I sincerely apologize, Venerable Sir.”',\n",

       "   'paragraphs': ['This exercise is to observe our anger in mindfulness. In Buddhism, we learn that a person is comprised of the Five Aggregates of form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Anger belongs to the aggregate of mental formations, and the unpleasant feeling that goes along with the anger belongs to the aggregate of feelings. The mastery of our anger is an important step on the path of practice. Identifying the presence and the absence of anger in us brings many benefits. For our work of mindful observation to be wholehearted, we combine the work of observation with conscious breathing.',\n",
       "    'The first benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is that we see that when anger is not present, we are much happier. Anger is like a flame blazing up and consuming our self-control, making us think, say, and do things that we will probably regret later. The actions of body, speech, and mind that we perform while we’re angry take us a long way along the road to hell. We may never have seen the Avici hells, but we can see clearly that whenever someone is angry, he is abiding in one of the hot hells. Anger and hatred are the materials of which the Avici hells are made. A mind without anger—cool, fresh, and sane—is one of the eleven wholesome mental formations. The absence of anger is the basis of real happiness, the basis of love and compassion.',\n",
       "    'The second benefit of mindfully observing the presence and absence of anger is that by just identifying our anger, it loses some of its destructive nature. Only when we’re angry and not observing our anger mindfully does our anger become destructive. When anger is born in us, we should follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger. When we do that, mindfulness has already been born in us, and anger can no longer monopolize our consciousness. Awareness stands alongside the anger: “I know that I am angry.” This awareness is a companion for the anger. Our mindful observation is not to suppress or drive out our anger, but just to look after it. This is a very important principle in meditation practice. Mindful observation is like a lamp that gives light. It’s not a judge. It throws light on our anger, sponsors it, looks after it in an affectionate and caring way, like an older sister looking after and comforting her younger sibling.',\n",
       "    'When we’re angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase away our anger is to suppress or chase away ourselves. When we’re joyful, we are joy. When we’re angry, we are anger. When we love, we are love. When we hate, we are hatred. When anger is born, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can change that energy into another kind of energy. If we want to transform it, first we have to know how to accept it. For example, a garbage can filled with decomposing and smelly organic material can be transformed into compost and later into beautiful roses. At first, we may see the garbage and the flowers as separate and opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the garbage, and the garbage already exists in the flowers. The beautiful rose contains the garbage in it; if we look carefully, we can see that. It only takes one week for a flower to become garbage. The smelly garbage already contains beautiful flowers and fragrant herbs, such as coriander and basil. When a good organic gardener looks into the garbage can, she can see that, and so she does not feel sad or disgusted. Instead, she values the garbage and doesn’t discriminate against it. It takes only a few months for garbage to transform into fragrant herbs and flowers. We also need the insight and nondual vision of the organic gardener with regard to anger and despair. We need not be afraid of them or reject them. We know that anger is a kind of garbage, but that it’s within our power to transform it. We need it in the way the organic gardener needs compost. If we know how to accept our anger, we already have some peace and joy. Gradually we can transform anger completely.',\n",
       "    'When anger arises, other mental formations, which are lying latent in the depths of our consciousness, are not arising. This deep consciousness is called alaya by the Vijñanavada school. Joy, sadness, love, and hate, for example, are present in alaya when we are angry, but they are lying beneath the surface without manifesting, like seeds (Sanskrit: bija) in the ground. If we let the anger express itself without giving it a sponsor, it can do a lot of damage inside and outside of us. When the mental formation mindfulness arises from alaya, it can become the spiritual friend of the mental formation anger. As we follow our breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness, the situation becomes less and less dangerous. Although the anger is still there, it gradually loses its strength and begins to transform into another kind of energy, like love or understanding.',\n",
       "    'Mindfulness is like a lamp illuminating ourselves. As soon as the lamp is brought into the room, the room changes. When the sun rises, the light of the sun only has to shine onto the plants for them to change, grow, and develop. The light of the sun appears not to be doing anything at all, but in truth it is doing a lot. Under the influence of the sun, the plants produce chlorophyll and become green. It is thanks to the growth of plants that the animal species have what they need to survive. If the sun keeps shining on the bud, the flower will open. When the light of the sun penetrates the flower bud, the photons transform it, and the flower opens. Our mindfulness has the same function as the light of the sun. If we shine the light of full awareness steadily on our state of mind, that state of mind will transform into something better.',\n",
       "    'Thanks to the illuminating light of awareness, we can see the roots of our anger. The point of meditation is to look deeply into things in order to be able to see their nature. The nature of things is interdependent origination, the true source of everything that is. If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding (or ignorance), clumsiness (or lack of skill), the surrounding society, hidden resentment, and habit (or our conditioning). These roots can be present both in ourselves and in the person who played the principal role in allowing the anger to arise. We observe mindfully in order to be able to see and to understand. Seeing and understanding are the elements of liberation that allow us to be free of the suffering which always accompanies anger. Seeing and understanding bring about love and compassion. They are the balm of the bodhisattva’s compassion that cools our hearts and mind. As we have already seen, our anger is a field of energy. Thanks to our mindful observation and insight into its roots, we can change this energy into the energy of love and compassion—a constructive and healing energy.',\n",
       "    'Usually when people are angry, they say and do things that cause damage to others and themselves. There are people who speak and act in ways that wound others. They believe that doing so will release the field of angry energy that is burning in their hearts. They shout and scream, beat things, and shoot poisoned arrows of speech at others. These methods of release are dangerous.',\n",
       "    'Sometimes people try to find ways to express their anger in a less dangerous way. They may go into their room, close the door behind them, and pound a pillow with all their might. Naturally if you beat a pillow until your energy is exhausted, your anger will subside, and you’ll probably experience a temporary feeling of relief—exhaustion is easier to bear than anger—but the roots of the anger remain untouched, and when the conditions are right, the same anger will arise again. Therefore, the method of mindful observation in order to see and to understand the roots of our anger is the only method that has lasting effectiveness.',\n",
       "    'As we’ve seen already, when anger arises, we first need to come back to our conscious breathing and sponsor our anger with mindfulness. We concentrate on our breathing in order to maintain mindfulness. We avoid listening to or looking at the person whom we regard as the cause of our anger. Usually when we’re angry, we don’t return to ourselves and take care of healing our anger. We want to think about the hateful aspects of the person who has made us angry—rudeness, dishonesty, cruelty, maliciousness, and so on. The more we think of them, listen to them, or look at them, the more our anger flares up. Their hatefulness may be real, imaginary, or exaggerated, but whatever it is that’s making us angry, we’re inclined to give our full attention to that. In fact, the root of our problem is the anger inside of us, and we have to come back to it and take care of it first of all. Like a firefighter, we must put water on the blaze immediately and not waste time looking for the person who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must take care of my anger.” So it’s best not to listen to, look at, or think about the other person, or to say or do anything as long as anger persists. If we put our mind into the work of observing and calming our anger, we’ll avoid creating damage that we would probably regret later. We may like to go outside and practice walking meditation. The fresh air, green trees, and the plants will help us greatly. As we walk, we can recite this verse:',\n",
       "    'Mindfulness embraces the feeling, as a mother holds her crying child in her arms and transmits all her affection and care. If a mother puts all her heart and mind into caring for her baby, the baby will feel the mother’s gentleness and will calm down. In the same way, we can calm the functioning of our mind.',\n",
       "    'In order to lessen the unpleasant feeling brought about by the anger, we give our whole heart and mind to the practice of walking meditation, combining our breath with our steps and giving full attention to the contact between the soles of our feet and the earth. After a while, our anger will calm down, and we become stronger. Then we can begin to observe the anger and its true nature.',\n",
       "    'We know that we can’t eat potatoes without cooking them first. We fill our pot with water, put the lid on, and light the fire. The lid of the pot, which keeps the heat inside, is the power of concentration—not to speak, not to listen, not to do anything at all, but just to concentrate our whole mind on our breathing. As soon as the pot is on the fire, the water begins to get warm. When we practice conscious breathing, although our anger is still there, it’s accompanied by mindfulness, the fire under the potatoes. The anger—the potatoes—has started to transform. Half an hour later, the potatoes are cooked, and our anger is transformed. We can smile, and we know that we understand the roots of our anger, and we can face the person who precipitated it.',\n",
       "    'Our anger is rooted in our lack of understanding of ourselves and of the causes, deep-seated as well as immediate, which have brought about this unpleasant state of affairs. Anger is also rooted in desire, pride, agitation, and suspiciousness. Our method of dealing with events as they arise reflects our state of understanding as well as our state of confusion. The chief roots of our anger are in ourselves. Our environment and other people are only secondary roots.',\n",
       "    'We can put up with the damage brought about by an earthquake or a flood, but if people had caused the same damage, we might not show much patience, and anger and hatred may arise in us. But if we know that earthquakes and floods have causes, we should also be able to see that there are causes—deep-seated or immediate—of the harm done to us by people. We need to see and understand these causes also. We have to see hardships brought about by others as a sort of natural disaster. These people make our lives difficult because they’re ignorant, prisoners of their desires or their hatreds. If we speak angrily to them and treat them as our enemy, then we’re just doing what they are doing, and we’re no different from them. In order to realize the state of no anger in our conscious and subconscious mind, we have to practice the meditations on love and compassion.'],\n",

       "   'paragraphs': ['In the Anguttara Nikaya (V, 161), the Buddha teaches, “If a mind of anger arises, the bhikkhu can practice the meditation on love, on compassion, or on equanimity for the person who has brought about the feeling of anger.” Love meditation is a method for developing the mind of love and compassion. Love (Pali: metta; Sanskrit: maitri) is a mind that is intent on bringing peace, joy, and happiness to others. Compassion (Sanskrit: karuna) is a mind that is intent on removing the suffering which is present in others. That is the meaning of the phrase, “Love is the capacity to give joy. Compassion is the power to relieve suffering.” When love and compassion are sources of energy in us, they bring peace, joy, and happiness to those dear to us and to others also.',\n",
       "    'We all have the seeds of love and compassion in us, and we can develop these fine and wonderful sources of energy. Maitri and karuna aren’t the kinds of love that try to possess and appropriate, to dictate and bring about suffering for ourselves and those we love. Maitri and karuna are the kinds of unconditional love that don’t expect anything in return. Consequently they don’t result in anxiety, boredom, or sorrow.',\n",
       "    'The essence of love and compassion is understanding, the ability to recognize the suffering of others. We have to be in touch with the physical, material, and psychological suffering of others. To do so, we have to put ourselves “inside the skin” of the other. We must “go inside” their body, feelings, and mental formations and experience their suffering. A shallow observation as an outsider won’t help us see their suffering. In the Satipatthana Sutta, we’re taught to be one with the object of our observation. We observe the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mental formations in the mental formations.',\n",
       "    'When we’re in contact with the suffering of another, a feeling of compassion is born in us immediately. Compassion literally means “to suffer with” the other. Looking in order to see the suffering in another person is the work of meditation. If we sit cross-legged, follow our breathing, and observe someone mindfully, we can be in contact with his suffering, and the energy of compassion arises in us. We can also do this while walking, standing, lying down, sitting, speaking, and acting, not just when we are sitting in meditation. The physical and psychological suffering of that person will be clear to us in the light of our mindful observation.',\n",
       "    'When the mind of compassion arises, we have to find ways to nourish and express it. When we come into contact with the other person, our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion, even if that person says and does things that are not easy to accept. We practice in this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person apologizing or being lovable. Then we can be sure that our mind of compassion is firm and authentic. We’ll recognize in ourselves some of the beautiful signs of the compassionate mind: (1) our sleep is more relaxed, (2) we do not have nightmares, (3) our waking-state is more at ease, (4) we’re not anxious or depressed, and (5) we’re protected by everyone and everything around us. The person who has been the object of our meditation on compassion will also, eventually, benefit from our meditation. His suffering will slowly diminish, and his life will gradually be brighter and more joyful.',\n",
       "    'We can begin our meditation on compassion with someone who is undergoing suffering of a physical or material kind—someone who is weak and easily ill, poor, or oppressed, or has no protection. This kind of suffering is easy to see. We observe it deeply, either during sitting meditation or when we’re actually in contact with it. We must have enough time if we’re going to be in deep contact with the suffering of that person. We have to observe until the mind of compassion arises, and the substance of the mind of compassion penetrates into our being. Then the mind of compassion will envelop the object of our observation. If we observe deeply in this way, the mind of compassion will naturally be transformed into action. We won’t just say, “I love her very much,” but instead, “I must do something so that she’ll suffer less.” The mind of compassion is truly present when it has the capacity of removing suffering.',\n",
       "    'After that, we can practice being in contact with more subtle forms of suffering. Sometimes the other person doesn’t seem to be suffering at all, but we may notice that she has sorrows which have left their marks in hidden ways. Someone with more than enough material comforts can also be subject to suffering. There are very few people who are not suffering to some degree. The person who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to sit down, follow our breathing, and look deeply, and naturally we’ll see her suffering.',\n",
       "    'We may be able to see how her misery has come about because of the lack of skill of the parents who raised her. But her parents may have been the victims of their parents. The suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation, and it has been reborn in her. If we can see that, we’ll no longer blame her for making us suffer, because we understand the way in which she is also a victim. To look deeply is to understand. Once we understand, it’s easy to embrace the other person in our mind of compassion.',\n",
       "    'To look deeply into the suffering of those who have caused us to suffer is a miraculous gift. Thanks to our observation, we now know that the person is suffering. He may think that his suffering will be lessened if he can cause us to suffer. Once we’re in touch with his suffering, our enmity and bitterness towards him will vanish, and we’ll long for him to suffer less. The spring water of the compassionate mind begins to flow, and we ourselves are the first to be cleansed by it. We feel cool and light, and we can smile. We don’t need two people to bring about reconciliation. When we look deeply, we become reconciled with ourselves and, for us, the problem no longer exists. Sooner or later, the other will see our attitude and share in the freshness of the stream of love which is flowing naturally in our heart.',\n",
       "    'After we experience the fruit of the meditation of compassion, the meditation on love becomes relatively easy. Just as with the mind of compassion, the mind of love brings peace, joy, and happiness to the practitioner first. We know that if we don’t have peace and joy ourselves, we won’t have peace and joy to share with others. That’s why the meditation on compassion and the meditation on love bring benefits both to the practitioner and to others.',\n",
       "    'When we reduce the suffering in others, we also bring them happiness at the same time. Although life is suffering, it also has many wonderful things like the early morning sky, the harvest moon, the forsythia bush, the violet bamboo, the stream of clear water, and the beautiful child. When we pay attention only to our suffering, we’re not able to make contact with these wonderful things, and anything we say or do will not untie the knot of suffering and bring about the conditions for living joyfully. Mindful observation is the element that nourishes the tree of understanding, and compassion and love are the most beautiful flowers. When we realize the mind of love, we have to go to the one who has been the object of our mindful observation, so that our mind of love is not just an object of our imagination but is a source of energy that has an effect in the real world.',\n",
       "    'The Buddha teaches that during our meditation we can send our mind of love and compassion into the four directions and embrace all species of living beings. But we must be careful not to think that the meditations of love and compassion consist in just sitting still and imagining that our mind of love and compassion will spread out into space like waves of sound or light. Sound and light have the ability to penetrate everywhere, and love and compassion can do the same. But if our love and compassion are only a kind of imagining—for example, if we imagine they are like a pure white cloud that slowly forms and gradually spreads out and out to envelop the whole world—then they’ll have no effect; they’re only a cloud of the imagination. A true cloud can produce rain. It’s only in the midst of our daily life and in our actual contact with people and other species, including the object of our meditation, that we can know whether our mind of love and compassion is really present and whether it is stable. If love and compassion are real, they’ll be evident in our daily life, in the way we talk with people and the way we act in the world. The sitting meditation position is not the only position in which we can give rise to the spring water of love and compassion.',\n",
       "    'Many people think that if they don’t have influence and money, they can’t realize love and compassion. In fact, the source of love and compassion is in us, and we can help many people suffer less and realize a lot of happiness without being rich or influential. One word, one action, or one thought can reduce another person’s suffering and bring him joy. One word can give comfort and confidence, destroy doubt, help someone avoid a mistake, reconcile a conflict, open the door to liberation, or show him the way to success and happiness. One action can save a person’s life or help him take advantage of a rare opportunity. One thought can do the same, because thoughts lead to words and action. If love and compassion are in our hearts, every thought, word, and deed can bring about a miracle. Because understanding is the very foundation of love and compassion, the words and actions engendered by love and compassion will be ones that are helpful. When we want to help, we know how to avoid the kind of love that does more harm than good. We must always remember that love is none other than understanding.'],\n",

       "   'paragraphs': ['Ignorance, or delusion, is the erroneous perception of things. In order to correct our erroneous perceptions, the Buddha teaches us a method of discriminative investigation, which relates to the establishment of the mind and the establishment of the objects of mind. The objects of mind are also called dharmas (all that can be conceived of as existing). They include the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses. The six sense organs are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The six sense objects are form and color, sound, smell, taste, tactile objects, and mind-objects (every concept and every thing that belongs to the sphere of memory and mental experience). The sense six consciousnesses are: eye-consciousness (or sight), ear-consciousness (or hearing), nose-consciousness (or smelling), taste-consciousness (or tasting), body-consciousness (or touching), and mind-consciousness. All dharmas are contained within these Eighteen Realms (Sanskrit: dhatu), which include all psychological, physiological, and physical aspects. All Eighteen Realms are also called objects of mind, including mental formations. When mind is observing mind, the mind becomes an object of mind.',\n",
       "    'The basic characteristic of all dharmas is interdependent origination. All dharmas arise, endure, and fade away according to the law of interdependence. In the Majjhima Nikaya, it is taught: “This is, because that is; this is not, because that is not. This is produced, because that is produced. This is destroyed, because that is destroyed.” The Buddhist principle of interdependence, put forward with the utmost simplicity, is immeasurably deep. According to this teaching, no single dharma can arise by itself, endure by itself, and fade away by itself. The coming-to-be of one dharma is dependent on the coming-to-be, endurance, and destruction of other dharmas, in fact, of all other dharmas. Dharmas do not have independent existence. They’re empty of a separate, independent existence.',\n",
       "    'In our daily life, we’re inclined to perceive things as real and independent of each other. Take, for example, a leaf we see on the branch in front of us. We may think that this leaf exists independently of all the other leaves, independently of the branch, the trunk, and the roots of the tree; independently of the clouds, the water, the earth, and the sky. In truth, this leaf could not be here without the presence of all the other things that we see as different from it. This leaf is one with the other leaves, the branch, the trunk, and the roots of the tree; with the clouds, the river, the earth, the sky, and the sunlight. If any one of these things were not present, the leaf could not be. If we look deeply into the leaf, we can see the presence of all these things. The leaf and these things are present together. This is the principle of interbeing and interpenetration, the principle of one is all and all is one, which the Avatamsaka Sutra, the most complete and sufficient expression of the Buddhist principle of interdependent origination, teaches. Things do not exist outside of each other. Things exist within each other and with each other. That is why the Buddha said: “This is, because that is.” With the power of concentration, we can observe all that is in the light of this principle. All phenomena in the universe, including the thoughts, words, and feelings of both ourselves and those around us, need to be observed in the light of interdependence.',\n",
       "    'This method of discriminative investigation begins by classifying the dharmas into categories like the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses, namely, the Eighteen Realms, which can also be classified according to the Five Aggregates of form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. By “form,” we mean all physiological and physical phenomena. “Feelings” means pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. “Perceptions” means basic conceptualizations and naming. “Mental formations” means psychological states that arise and manifest in us. “Consciousness” is the function of maintaining, cognizing, comparing, storing, and remembering all the seeds. The basic Abhidharma writings and the teachings of the Vijñanavada school of Buddhist psychology give very thorough explanations of the essential nature of these five categories and the ways in which they function.',\n",
       "    'The Heart of the Prajñaparamita Sutra tells us that the Bodhisattva Avalokita, thanks to his observation of the Five Aggregates, was able to see the interdependent nature of all dharmas and realize their essential birthlessness and deathlessness, and so transcend the fear of birth and death. The same sutra refers to the essential emptiness (Sanskrit: sunyata) of all dharmas. Emptiness, here, means interdependence. All dharmas depend on each other in order to arise and to endure. There is no dharma which can exist apart from other dharmas, and that is why we say that the real nature of dharmas is emptiness. Nothing can exist on its own.',\n",
       "    'Through discriminative investigation, we realize the interdependent nature of all that is. This is to realize the empty nature of all things. With insight into emptiness, we’ll go beyond concepts of “it is” and “it is not,” birth and death, one and many, coming and going, and we’ll transcend the fear of birth and death. Our concepts of it is/it is not, birth/death, one/many, coming/going, and so on, will dissolve when we’re witness to the interdependent nature of all that is. To be able to end the concept of birth and death is the essential point of discriminative investigation.',\n",
       "    'Some days before the layman Anathapindika passed away, the Buddha sent the Venerable Sariputra and the Venerable Ananda to visit him and instruct him in his practice. Sitting at the layman’s bedside, the Venerable Sariputra began his instruction: “Layman Anathapindika, you should meditate like this: ‘These eyes are not me. I am not caught in these eyes.’ ” Anathapindika breathed and meditated according to the instructions. Sariputra continued his instructions: “These ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not me. I am not caught by forms, sounds, smells, tastes, contacts, or the thoughts that I have.” Anathapindika observed in this way in order to see gradually the interdependent nature of all that is, to see that he himself was not restricted to the Eighteen Realms (the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six sense consciousnesses), and to see that there’s no birth that brings us into existence and no death that takes us from existence to nonexistence.',\n",
       "    'When he had practiced this much, Anathapindika began to weep, the tears falling down his cheeks. The Venerable Ananda asked, “What is it? Do you regret anything? Did you not succeed in the meditation?” Anathapindika replied, “Venerable Ananda, I have nothing to regret, and my meditation has been very successful. I’m crying because I am so moved. I have been lucky enough to have served the Buddha and his community for many years, but I have never heard a teaching so deep, so wonderful, and so precious as the teaching transmitted by the Venerable Sariputra today.”',\n",

       "    'The Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness also describes the mind that is not in a state of ignorance and confusion, as when we are conscious of impermanence, interdependence, and selflessness; when our mind rests in Right View. Right View is one of the eight ways of practice called the Noble Eightfold Path.',\n",
       "    'In the section that teaches how to be mindful of the objects of mind, among the Seven Factors of Awakening (Sanskrit: saptabodhyanga), the investigation of dharmas is mentioned. Investigation of dharmas means the detailed examination of the source and the nature of phenomena whether physical or psychological. Investigation of dharmas has a meaning similar to discriminative investigation and is also intended to see the source and the nature of dharmas. If we can understand in depth the source and the nature of dharmas, then our mind is not in a state of ignorance or confusion.',\n",
       "    'Each of the above fifteen exercises from the Satipatthana Sutta has, to a greater or lesser degree, the function of mindfully observing the source of dharmas. The most obvious examples are the eighth exercise—observation of the interdependence of the body and all that is in the universe: earth, water, air, and fire—and the twelfth exercise—the observation of the source and the nature of our feelings.',\n",
       "    'When sitting in meditation, we concentrate our mind on the object of our observation—sometimes a physical phenomenon, sometimes psychological—and we look deeply into that object in order to discover its source and its nature. The role of our conscious breathing is to nourish and maintain our power of concentration on one object. If we look carefully and deeply, naturally we’ll see that the arising, enduring, and ending of the object is dependent on other things. Eventually we’ll see that the true nature of all dharmas is birthlessness and deathlessness, and that although dharmas are not everlasting, they’re never totally destroyed. Thus the mindful observation of interdependence is the road that leads us to transcend the limits of birth and death. A student of Buddhism who doesn’t practice the mindful observation of interdependence hasn’t yet arrived at the quintessence of the Buddhist path.'],\n",

       "    'Internal formations can be classified as two kinds, the Five Dull Knots: confusion, desire, anger, pride, and doubt; and the Five Sharp Knots: view of the body as self, extreme views, wrong views, perverted views, and superstitious views (or unnecessary ritual prohibitions). The latter are easier to correct. When the eyes see form, the ears hear sound, the nose smells a scent, the tongue tastes something, the body touches something, or the mind cognizes an object, knots may or may not be tied, depending on the way in which our mind receives these impressions. When someone speaks unkindly to us, if we understand the reason and we do not take the words to heart, we won’t feel at all irritated, and a knot won’t be formed in our mind. If we don’t understand the reason and we feel irritated, a knot will form. The substance of this knot will be hatred. When we misunderstand someone’s words or behavior, the knot that forms is confusion, which often gives rise to irritation, pride, attachment, and doubt. The knot of confusion, a lack of clear seeing, or ignorance (Sanskrit: avidya), is the basis for every other knot.',\n",
       "    'The feelings associated with internal formations are usually unpleasant, but sometimes internal formations are associated with pleasant feelings. When we are attached to a form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or mind object, an internal formation of the nature of desire is formed. To begin with, it can be associated with a pleasant feeling. But because we become attached to it, we are bound, and when the demands of the attachment are not met, the feelings become unpleasant. Anything from wine, tobacco, or opium to beautiful forms, good food, music, or words of praise can produce a knot in us, an internal formation that begins as a pleasant feeling. Once we have a such a knot, we are tied tightly by it, and we are forced to seek out the object of sense again and again in order to repeat the pleasant feeling.',\n",
       "    'Falling in love is also an internal formation, because in it there is the material of blind attachment. The term to “fall” in love in itself sounds disastrous. People often refer to love-sickness, as if falling in love were a disease. The French expression coup de foudre (struck by lightning) describes falling in love as a sharp blow. The author Nguyên Bính has said, “Alas, only the gods can save someone who has fallen in love.” But being in love can be transformed, so that blind attachment, selfishness, and domination are replaced by the capacity to understand and bring happiness to the person we love, without demanding specific conditions and expecting something in return. To transform being in love in this way is to transform an internal formation.',\n",
       "    'Feelings of sorrow in us are also internal formations that arise from confusion, desire, hatred, pride, and doubt. If these roots of affliction are not transformed, the feelings of sorrow will remain intact in us. In everyday life, seeds of sorrow can be sown in our consciousness with or without the collaboration of others. Others may say or do things that produce knots in us, but if we give birth to the seeds of understanding, tolerance, love, and compassion, then what they say and do will not produce any internal formations in us. It depends on the way in which we receive what happens to us in our daily lives. If we are stable, relaxed, understanding, loving, compassionate, and not caught in egotism, then the things others do and say will not have the force to produce an internal formation in us.',\n",
       "    'If we live according to the teachings of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, we practice mindful observation of the arising, duration, and transformation of internal formations. In our daily life, we practice full awareness in order to be able to recognize the internal formation just born and find a way to transform it. If we allow internal formations to grow strong in us, the time will come when they will dominate us, and the work of transforming them will be extremely difficult. An internal formation of hatred, desire, or doubt needs our full attention as soon as it arises so that it may be transformed. When it arises for the first time, the knot is still very “loose” and the work of “untying it” is easy.',\n",

By practicing understanding and loving speech, we can help each other a great deal. Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. Therefore, to transform the internal formations in the other is to bring about our own happiness as well. A person can create internal formations in her partner, and her partner can do so for her, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day they’ll have no happiness left. A person needs to recognize quickly any newly formed knot inside herself. She should take the time to observe it and, with her partner’s help, transform the internal formation. She might say, “Darling, I have an internal formation. Can you please help me?” This is easy when the states of mind of both partners are still light and not loaded with many internal formations.',\n",

The internal formations of desire, anger, fear, feeling worthless, and regret have been suppressed in our subconscious for a long time. Although they are suppressed, they are always seeking ways to manifest in our feelings, thoughts, words, and actions. It is easy for us to observe our internal formations when they appear as feelings on the surface of consciousness, but internal formations that are repressed cannot appear in a direct and natural way in the conscious mind. They only disclose themselves indirectly. Thus we’re not aware of their presence, although they continue to tie us up and make us suffer in a latent way.',\n",
       "    'What is it that represses them and does not let them appear? It is our conscious, reasoning mind. We know that our desires and anger are not wholly acceptable to society and to our own reasoning mind, so we’ve found a way to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to be able to forget them. This is the work of a mental formation called mushita smrti, forgetfulness. Contemporary psychology understands repression. Because we want to avoid suffering, there are defense mechanisms in us that push our psychological pains, conflicts, and unacceptable desires into our unconscious so that we can feel more at peace with ourselves. But our longstanding repressions are always looking for ways to manifest in words, images, and behavior unacceptable to society and can later become symptoms of physical and psychological illness. We may know that our words, thoughts, and behavior are destructive, but we can’t do anything about them because our internal formations are so strong.',\n",

The daughter understands and loves her mother, but she also wants to be independent and/or live with the person she loves. However, her mother is sick and needs someone to support her, and the daughter can’t bear the thought of leaving her alone. The opposing desires and feelings bring about an internal conflict in the daughter. And so her defense mechanism represses the pain of the conflict in her unconscious and tells her to devote her life to supporting her mother. Nevertheless, the desire to be with her own partner is still there, and the psychological conflict remains an internal formation looking for a way to manifest. She becomes irritable and says things which even she herself does not understand, and she has dreams which are incomprehensible to her. She is not happy, and so her mother can’t be happy either. In fact, her mother has been haunted for years by the fear that her daughter will leave her, and it is this psychological factor that made her unexpectedly fall sick and grow weak, although she’s not aware of it. When she heard her daughter say that she was going to stay, she was very pleased, but in the depths of her heart, she suffers because she knows that her daughter is prevented from doing something she wants to do. This conflict becomes an internal formation in the mother, which makes her suffer, and the mother also becomes irritable and says things which she herself does not understand. She also has dreams she doesn’t understand, and she does things without knowing why she’s doing them. Neither the mother nor the daughter is happy, and both continue to suffer.',\n",

But to observe them, first of all we have to find ways to bring them into the realm of the conscious mind. The method of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is to practice conscious breathing in order to recognize our feelings, thoughts, words, and actions, especially those which arise automatically, as reactions to what is happening. Our reactions may have their roots in the internal formations buried inside us.',\n",

Why do I always think of my mother when I see that woman? Why did I say that to him? Why didn’t I like that character in the film? Whom did I hate in the past who this person resembles? Practices like this can help us discover the roots of our feelings, thoughts, words, and behavior and gradually bring the internal formations buried in us into the realm of the conscious mind.',\n",
       "    'During our sitting meditation, because we have closed the doors of our sensory input in order to stop listening, looking, and reasoning, the internal formations that are buried in us have the opportunity to reveal themselves in the form of feelings or images that manifest in our conscious mind. To begin with, there may be just a feeling of anxiety, fear, or unpleasantness, whose cause we can’t see. We have to shine the light of mindfulness on it and be ready to see this feeling.',\n",
       "    'When this feeling begins to show its face and to gather strength and become more intense, we may feel it robs us of all our peace, joy, and ease. We may not want to be in contact with it anymore. We may want to move our attention to another object of meditation. We may not want to continue with the meditation, and we may say that we’re sleepy and would prefer to meditate some other time. In modern psychology, this is called resistance. Deep down we are afraid to bring into our conscious mind the feelings of pain that are buried within us, because they’ll make us suffer.',\n",
       "    'There are people who practice sitting meditation many hours a day, but they do not really dare to face and invite their feelings of pain into their conscious mind. They deceive themselves that these feelings aren’t important and they give their attention to other subjects of meditation—impermanence, selflessness, the sound of one hand clapping, or the reason Bodhidharma came to the West. This isn’t to suggest that these subjects are unimportant, but they should be considered in the light of our real problems in order to be authentic subjects for meditation practice.',\n",
       "    'We don’t practice mindfulness in Buddhism in order to repress our feelings, but as a way of looking after our feelings, being their sponsor in an affectionate, nonviolent way. When we’re able to maintain mindfulness, we’re not carried away by or drowned in our feelings or in the conflicts within ourselves. We nourish and maintain mindfulness through conscious breathing and try to become aware of our internal formations and conflicts as they manifest. We receive them with love as a mother takes her child in her arms: “Mindfulness is present, and I know that I have enough strength to be in contact with the knots in me.” In this kind of an environment, our internal formations will manifest as feelings and images in our mind that we can contact and identify fully and deeply.',\n",
       "    'Without judgment, blame, or criticism for having these feelings or images, we just observe, identify, and accept them in order to see their source and their true nature. If there’s pain, we feel the pain. If there’s sadness, we are sad. If there’s anger, then we are angry, but our anger is accompanied by mindfulness. We don’t lose ourselves in the pain, the sadness, or the anger, but we calm them down. Even if we haven’t seen the roots of the internal formations, the fact that we can greet our pain, our sadness, and our anger in mindfulness already causes our internal knots to lose some of their strength. Thanks to our vigilant observation, eventually we’ll see their roots and transform them. The teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness on how to be in direct contact with our feelings and invite them up to manifest on the surface of our consciousness is wonderfully effective. The practitioner can work with difficult internal formations with the help of a teacher or of a co-practitioner. The teacher and the co-practitioners, because of their mindful observation, can help point out to him the manifestations of the internal formations that lie deep in his consciousness.',\n",
       "    'In his lifetime, the Buddha was praised as being a King of Doctors, and he helped thousands of people, including King Ajatasatru of Magadha, deal with mental problems. Those who practice mindful observation can learn the Buddhist way of dealing with internal formations in order to help themselves and others. Because many people live without practicing mindfulness and don’t know how to transform internal formations, over time these internal formations become strong and lead to agitation, anxiety, and depression, which express themselves in speech and behavior that are not easily acceptable by society. Those with strong internal formations have difficulty relating to and working with others, and these difficulties make them feel more and more unsuccessful in society.

If regret creates a guilt-complex that follows and haunts us, then it’s an obstacle to our practice.',\n",

But the past has created the present, and if we practice mindfulness in the present, we naturally are in contact with the past. As we transform the present, we also transform the past. Our ancestors, parents, brothers, and sisters are all closely linked to us—our suffering and happiness is closely linked to theirs, just as their suffering and happiness is closely linked to ours. If we can transform ourselves, we also transform them. Our own emancipation, peace, and joy is the emancipation, peace, and joy of our ancestors and our parents. To take hold of the present in order to transform it is the unique way to bring peace, joy, and emancipation to those we love and to heal the damage done in the past.',\n",

If we take hold of life in the present moment in order to transform ourselves, we can create joy for ourselves and for everyone else as well. This transformation will bring about real joy and peace in the present and also in the future. It’s not just a hollow promise to do better. If we can take hold of our breathing and live in a mindful way, thus bringing joy and happiness to ourselves and others in the present moment, we can overcome our complexes of guilt so that we’re no longer paralyzed by them.',\n",

But if that person practices mindfulness and is able to be in real contact with the present moment, knowing what to do and what not to do in the present moment, she can save the lives of many children. Many small children die for want of medicine. Many children die through accidents or for want of proper care and attention.

Insecurity and fear of what might happen to us and those dear to us are feelings we all have, but for some, these insecurities and fears dominate their consciousness. In Mahayana Buddhism, the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara is described as the one who has transcended all fear. He offers all beings the gift of non-fear (Sanskrit: abhaya), which comes from the mindful observation of the no-birth, no-death, no-increase, and no-decrease nature of all that is. The Prajñaparamita Heart Sutra is an exhortation on fearlessness. If we can observe deeply the interdependent and selfless nature of all things, we can see that there is no birth and no death and pass beyond all fear.4',\n",

If we know that birth and death are both necessary aspects of life, we’ll see that if our mother the Earth has brought us to life once, she will bring us to life one hundred thousand times more, and we will not be afraid or suffer when she reaches out her arms to welcome us back.

       "    'Buddhist psychology talks of seeds as the basis of every state of mind and the content of our consciousness. Certain seeds were transmitted to us by our parents and our ancestors. These are seeds of Buddha, Bodhisattva, Pratyekabuddha (one who has reached liberation by one’s own efforts but just for one’s own sake), Sravaka (one who practices as a disciple by listening to the teachings), God, Human, Warrior-God, Animal, Hungry Ghost, and Hell-Being. This means that before we were born, there were already many kinds of wholesome and unwholesome seeds in us. In addition, there are many kinds of seeds that form in us from an early age, planted by our family, school, and society. Seeds that produce suffering we can call “unwholesome,” and seeds that produce happiness we can call “wholesome.”',\n",
       "    'According to the principle of interdependent origination, seeds do not have a fixed nature. Every seed is dependent on every other seed for its existence, and in any one seed, all the other seeds are present. Any unwholesome seed contains within it the germ of wholesome seeds, and a wholesome seed contains within it the germ of unwholesome seeds. Just as there has to be night for there to be day and death for there to be birth, an unwholesome seed can be transformed into a wholesome seed, and a wholesome seed can be transformed into an unwholesome seed. This fact tells us that in the darkest times of our lives, in the times of the greatest suffering, the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness are still present in us. If we know how to contact the seeds of joy, peace, and happiness that are already present in us, and if we know how to water and look after them, they will germinate and bring us the fruits of peace, joy, and liberation.',\n",
       "    'The sutra is always reminding us of the two contrasting aspects of the mind. The state of mind that has no desire is a wholesome state of mind called “desirelessness.” The state of mind that has no anger is a wholesome state of mind called “no-anger.” Desirelessness, no-anger, and freedom are wholesome seeds in the mind that need to be watered and cared for.',\n",
       "    'The sutras often refer to the mind as a plot of ground in which all sorts of seeds are sown. That is why we have the Sanskrit term cittabhumi, “the mind as the earth.” When we practice mindfulness, we should not just observe the phenomena of birth, old age, sickness, death, desire, hatred, aversion, ignorance, doubt, and wrong views. We should also take the time to observe objects of the mind that lead to health, joy, and emancipation in order to enable wholesome seeds to germinate and flower in the field of the mind. Observing Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, love, compassion, joy, letting go, mindfulness, investigation of dharmas, ease, happiness, and equanimity, is always encouraged in Buddhism. Joy (Sanskrit: mudita), for example, is not just the joy that arises from the joy of others, but also the feeling of well-being that arises in ourselves. Mudita is one of the Four Unlimited Minds; love, compassion, and letting go or equanimity are the other three. The seeds of mudita are in all of us. Only when we have joy in our lives can we be happy and have the means to share our happiness with others. If we do not have joy, what can we share with others? If the seeds of our joy are buried under many layers of suffering, how can we smile and share joy with others? This exercise helps us stay in touch with the wholesome seeds in us so that they have a chance to develop.',\n",

There is spring as well as winter, light as well as darkness, health as well as sickness, gentle breezes and delightful rains as well as tempests and floods. Our eyes, ears, hearts, half-smiles, and breathing are wonderful phenomena. We only need to open our eyes and we can see the blue sky, the white clouds, the rose, the clear river, the golden fields of wheat, the shining eyes of a child. We only have to attune our ears to hear the whispering pines and the waves washing up on the shore. Everything is impermanent. Everything is in a temporary form. Nevertheless, there are many wonderful things. In us and around us, there are so many wondrous phenomena in nature that can refresh and heal us. If we can be in contact with them, we will receive their healing benefits. If peace and joy are in our hearts, we will gradually bring more peace and joy to the world.',\n",

It is important that we be aware of these ugly, dangerous things in the world, so that we can begin to improve the situation. But if, day after day, we are only in contact with our anxieties and our anger about what is ugly and corrupt, we will lose our joy and our ability to serve others. That is why we have to be in contact with the peaceful and positive aspects in and around us and be able to enjoy them. We need to teach our children how to appreciate these wondrous and precious things. If we know how to appreciate them, we will know how to protect them. This basic practice will protect our happiness and our children’s happiness as well.',\n",
       "    'There are many people who, although they know in theory that a flower is a wonderful thing, are unable to be in contact with it, because the sorrow in their hearts has closed them off. In the past, they may not have allowed themselves to be in contact with the refreshing, healthy seeds in their consciousness, and as a result, they are now cut off from them. The seventh precept of the Order of Interbeing reminds us to practice conscious breathing in order to stay in contact with the many healing and refreshing elements which are already around us. At times we may need the support of a friend to help us get back in touch with what is wonderful in life. “A meal needs soup as the practice needs friends” is a Vietnamese proverb about the importance of practicing with friends. Such a community of friends and fellow practitioners is called a Sangha. On the path of practice we need the support of this community, and so we say, “I take refuge in the Sangha.”',\n",

When we feel helpless, depressed, and discouraged, we can go to that friend, and, sitting with him, we can reestablish our equilibrium and once again be able to contact the flower and the other wonderful, refreshing things that exist within us and around us. If we receive the benefits of the joy that our friend brings us, we can refresh the seeds of healing in us that have become weak because they have not been cared for or watered for a long time.',\n",

All Four Establishments of Mindfulness—body, feelings, mind, and dharmas—are objects of mind. Since mind and objects of mind are one, in observing its objects, mind is essentially observing mind. The word dharma in Buddhism is understood to mean the object of the mind and the content of the mind. Dharmas are classified as one of the Twelve Realms (Sanskrit: ayatana). The first six of these realms are the sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The remaining six are form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharmas. Dharmas are the object of the mind, as sounds are the object of the ears. The object of cognition and the subject of cognition do not exist independently of each other. Everything that exists has to arise in the mind. The culminating phase of the development of this principle is expressed in the phrase, “All is just mind. All phenomena are just consciousness,” which means, “Because of mind, all can exist. Because of consciousness, all phenomena can exist.” This is developed in the Vijñaptimatra school of Mahayana Buddhism.',\n",

In the Patthana (equivalent to the Sanskrit Mahapakarana), the phrase cittam samutthanam ca rupanam (“and mind is the arising point of forms”) is found.',\n",

Whether the phenomenon we observe is physiological, psychological, or physical, we know that it is not separate from our mind and is of one substance with our mind. Mind can be understood as individual mind and as collective mind. The Vijñanavada teachings make this very clear. We need to avoid thinking that the object we are observing is independent of our mind. We have to remember that it is manifested from our individual and collective consciousnesses. We observe the object of our mind in the way the right hand takes hold of the left hand. Your right hand is you and your left hand is also you.

The basis of true mind is awakened understanding, arising from mindfulness. Mindful observation brings out the light which exists in true mind, so that life can be revealed in its reality. In that light, confusion becomes understanding, wrong views become right views, mirages become reality, and deluded mind becomes true mind. Once mindful observation is born, it will penetrate the object of observation, illuminate it, and gradually reveal its true nature. The true mind arises from deluded mind. Things in their true nature and illusions are of the same basic substance. That is why practice is a matter of transforming deluded mind and not a matter of seeking for a true mind elsewhere. Just as the surface of a rough sea and that of the sea when it is calm are both manifestations of the same sea, true mind could not exist if there were no deluded mind. In the teaching on the Three Doors to Liberation (Pali: vimokkha-mukha), aimlessness (Sanskrit: apranihita) is the foundation for realization. What is meant by aimlessness is that we do not seek after an object outside of ourselves.

She will know that the rose needs the garbage for its existence, and the garbage needs the rose, because it is the rose that becomes garbage. Therefore, she will know how to accept the garbage in order to transform it into roses and will not be afraid when she sees the rose wither and turn into garbage. This is the principle of nonduality.

We know that our body and our feelings are ourselves and therefore we do not repress them, because to do so would be to repress ourselves. On the contrary, we accept our body and our feelings. Accepting does not mean craving. By accepting, we naturally reach a degree of peace and understanding.

Therefore, it is essential to see our roots of affliction in mindfulness. As long as the lamp of mindfulness shines its light, the darkness is transformed. We need to nourish mindfulness in ourselves by the practices of conscious breathing, hearing the sound of a bell, reciting gathas, and many other skillful means.',\n",

When we are tired or in pain, our body is trying to tell us that it is not happy and at ease. The body has its own language. As practitioners of mindfulness, we should know what our body is saying to us. When we feel a lot of pain in our legs during sitting meditation, we should smile and change our position slowly and gently in mindfulness. There is nothing wrong with changing our position. It does not waste our time. As long as mindfulness is maintained, the work of meditation continues. We should not bully ourselves. When we push ourselves around like that, not only do we lose our peace of mind and our joy, but we also lose our mindfulness and concentration. We practice sitting meditation to have liberation, peace, and joy, not to become a hero who is capable of enduring a lot of pain.',\n",

We embrace them affectionately in the arms of mindfulness, as a mother embraces her newborn child when it cries. A mother embraces the child with all her love for the child to feel comforted and stop crying. Mindfulness nourished by conscious breathing takes the feelings in its arms, becomes one with them, calms and transforms them.',\n",

As I did this, I was bathed in sweat. Although I was not lacking in strength, although I maintained mindfulness and did not fall from mindfulness, my body and my mind were not at peace, and I was worn out by these exhausting efforts.

I was taught in this way as a novice, and I always felt that it was a kind of brainwashing.',\n",
       "    'The method of the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is observing deeply in the spirit of “not craving and not feeling distaste.” Mindfulness does not cling, push away, reprimand, or repress, so that the true nature of all dharmas can reveal itself in the light of mindful observation. That the impermanent, selfless, and impure nature of all dharmas has the effect of causing suffering can be seen while we observe dharmas, but that is not because we repeat some formulas like the above, in an automatic way. When we look deeply and see the true nature of all dharmas, they will reveal themselves.',\n",
       "    'When we mechanically repeat, “Body is impure,” we are reciting a dogma. If we observe all physiological phenomena and see their impure nature, this is not dogma. It is our experience. If, during our mindful observation, we see that phenomena are sometimes pure and sometimes impure, then that is our experience. If we look even more deeply and see that phenomena are neither pure nor impure, that they transcend the concepts of pure and impure, we discover what is taught in the Heart of the Prajñaparamita Sutra. This sutra also teaches us to resist all dogmatic attitudes. We should not force ourselves to see the body as impure or the feelings as suffering. Although there may be some truth in the sentences, just repeating them dogmatically has the effect of cramming us with knowledge. While we observe in mindfulness, we may see that we have many painful feelings, but we will also see that we have many joyful and peaceful feelings and many neutral feelings. And if we look more deeply, we will see that neutral feelings can become joyful feelings, and that suffering and happiness are interdependent. Suffering is, because happiness is; and happiness is, because suffering is. When we repeat, “Mind is impermanent,” our attitude is still dogmatic. If the mind is impermanent, then the body must be impermanent and the feelings too. The same is true of “Dharmas are selfless.” If dharmas are selfless, so are body, mind, and feelings.',\n",
       "    'Therefore, the special teaching of the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is to observe all dharmas but not to have any fixed ideas, just to keep on observing mindfully without comment, without assuming any attitude towards the object you are observing. In this way, the true nature of the object will be able to reveal itself in the light of mindful observation, and you will have insight into wonderful discoveries such as no-birth no-death, neither pure nor impure, neither increasing nor decreasing, interpenetration, and interbeing.'],\n",

But in order for the practice to be easy and successful, it is very helpful to practice with a community, called a Sangha. The presence of those who practice mindful living is a great support and encouragement to us. Seeing people walking, sitting, being, and doing things in mindfulness, we are reminded to maintain mindfulness ourselves. In Buddhist communities, people use bells of mindfulness to remind one another to practice. The bell sounds from time to time and calls us back to being mindful. The presence of the people who practice around us is equivalent to the presence of several bells of mindfulness.',\n",

We should be able to participate from time to time in a retreat of five days or a week to practice mindfulness in a concentrated atmosphere. With friends we can organize from time to time a Day of Mindfulness to practice together. A Day of Mindfulness can also be organized in the family for all the adults and children to practice together. It is good if we can invite a number of friends to join us.',\n",

The correct practice of mindfulness can help us bring peace, joy, and release both to ourselves and to our family and friends as well. Those who practice mindful living will inevitably transform themselves and their way of life. They will live a more simple life and will have more time to enjoy themselves, their friends, and their natural environment. They will have more time to offer joy to others and to alleviate their suffering. And when the time comes, they will die in peace. They will know that to die is to begin anew or just to continue with another form of life. When we live our life this way, every day is a Happy Birthday, a Happy Continuation Day.'],\n",

But his teachings spread far beyond the area where that language was spoken, and there is no doubt that in the practice centers that lay beyond the alluvial plain of the Ganges River, the monks and nuns would have studied the Dharma in their own local languages. One day in the Jetavana monastery, two monks, Yamelu and Tekula, asked the Buddha if they could translate all his teachings into the classical meter of the Vedic language. They told the Buddha that they wanted to do so in order to protect the beauty and accuracy of the Dharma. But the Buddha did not want his teachings to become a precious object reserved for a scholarly elite. He wanted everyone to be able to study and practice the Dharma in her own language.',\n",

Five hundred elder bhikkhus were invited to attend this Collation Council, which was sponsored by King Ajatasatru of Magadha. The language of the collation would naturally have been Ardhamagadhi, the language of the Buddha. If the local districts later developed versions in their own languages, these would have been based on the collation of the Rajgir Council.',\n",
       "    'One hundred years later, a second council was convened in Vaisali to further collate the canon of the Buddha’s teachings. On this occasion, seven hundred bhikkhus were invited to attend. After the Second Council, in 375 BCE, the community of bhikkhus divided itself into two schools: the Sthavira, which tended to be conservative, and the Mahasanghika, which tended to promote development and reform. The followers of the Mahasanghika were more numerous. In the three hundred years that followed, many other schools branched off from these two schools. According to the Samayabhedoparacanacakra by Vasumitra, who belonged to the Sarvastivada school of the Northern tradition, there were eighteen schools in all.',\n",
       "    'The number of schools proliferated because of the many different ways of understanding and commenting on the teachings of the Buddha. The works in which these explanations are contained are called the Abhidharma and belong to the Sastra Pitaka. Each school has handed down its own versions of the Vinaya, Sutra, and Sastra Pitakas. All three pitakas of the Theravada school are intact thanks to the relatively stable ground for practice in Sri Lanka. The Tripitaka of this school is written in the Pali language, which originated in western India. The Theravada arose from the Vibhajyavada, which was a school opposing the Sarvastivada.',\n",

At that time, perhaps because King Asoka leaned more towards the Vibhajyavada sect, the Sarvastivadins moved to the north and established their base for development in Kashmir, where they flourished for more than one thousand years.',\n",

This version is exactly the same as the Pali Mahasatipatthana Sutta (number 20 in the Digha Nikaya), except that the latter has a little more text at the end. For purposes of this commentary, the Mahasatipatthana Sutta is regarded as version one.',\n",

The third version, The One Way In Sutra, is a translation of the Yi Ru Dao Jing (Ekottara Agama, sutra number 125 in the Taisho Revised Tripitaka). It comes from the Mahasanghika school, not in its original but in its later form.',\n",
       "    'In the Chinese Canon, the name of the translator of the Sutra on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness is given as Gautama Sanghadeva. Master Sanghadeva came from what is now Afghanistan and traveled to China in the fourth century, living from the year 383 in the capital Chang An, and after that in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin. He began the work of translation between 391 and 398. He probably had learned Chinese when he lived in Chang An.',\n",
       "    'The Chinese Canon also ascribes the translation of The One Way In Sutra to Gautama Sanghadeva. However, there are many reasons for thinking that the sutra was translated by the monk Dharmanandi. Master Dharmanandi was Khotanese. He traveled to China in the fourth century and took up residence in Chang An, where he translated sutras from 384-391. The book Marking the Era of Buddhism (K’ai Yuan Shi Pi Chiao Lu) says that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Sanghadeva. Master Tao An, in his introduction to The One Way In Sutra, says that it was Master Dharmanandi who read the original Sanskrit version for Zhu Fo Nian to translate into Chinese and for Gautama Sanghadeva to write down. After that, they brought the translated version to be examined by the translation school of Master Sanghadeva in Jian Kang, the capital of Dong Chin.',\n",
       "    'The Li Tai San Pao Chi, Volume 7 (Sui Dynasty), the Ta T’ang Nei Tien Lu, and the Ta T’ang Ch’an Ting Chung Ching Mu Lu, all say that there were two translations of the Ekottara Agama, one by Master Dharmanandi and one by Master Sanghadeva. The books Ch’u San Tsang Chi Chi and the Chung Ching Mu Lu of the Sui Dynasty, and the Sutra Index of the T’ang Dynasty, all say that the Ekottara Agama was translated by Master Dharmanandi. Judging from all of this information and from the literary style of the text, we conclude that there was only one translation of the Ekottara Agama, the translation of Master Dharmanandi.',\n",
       "    'The Mahasanghika school, which came into existence after the council at Vaisali, later divided into two branches, one going to the northwest and one to the south. There were five branches of Mahasanghika in the northwest, including the Lokottaravada, which was Mahayana in outlook. It was the Ekottara Agama of this branch, including the third version of the sutra on mindfulness presented in this book, that Dharmanandi translated. Therefore, our third version is more influenced by the Mahayana and can be said to be less close to the original teaching of the Buddha than the first two versions, because many later elements have infiltrated into it. Still, it contains the essence of the original teachings.'],\n",

       "    'A tone poem, a snatch of gentle, celebratory  music. A verse about death, which is really about life. A transmutation of death; the emptying of the veins of death, the letting in of light and air to those fearful spaces. How does one cope with death, when death strikes, repeatedly, senselessly, destroying the young, the noble, the brave, the self giving?  Grief  of course,  a period  of silence,  space  for mourning. Then afterward, a reassertion, acceptance. And finally, if one is lucky, endowed, perceptive, brave with the bravery of an artist and poet, he creates something that faces the cruelty, the horror, and he brings to that welter of blood, vengeance, cruelty, and deceit, a \"sea change.\"',\n",
       "    'It is one of the classic and very nearly crushing ironies of the long war in Vietnam; that we have been the recipient, time and again, of gifts of the spirit, gifts of art, profound understanding, hope communicated,  a definition of our selves that exceeds by far our expectation of ourselves. We have heard time and again, from the \"enemy,\" a stubborn distinction between ourselves as a people, and our leadership. Our people have been endowed (by presumption of the same \"enemy\") with compassion, political acuity, generosity, and goodness of spirit. We were a people saddled for a time with an unfortunate and cruel leadership, which persisted in bloodletting despite the best instinct of the majority. Thus went the reading of our character by our \"enemy.\"',\n",
       "    'Such definitions have a mysterious power of creating what they signify, in a sense at least analogous to the sacramental. One thinks of such \"opinions\" so stubbornly held, so patiently reiterated over so long a period of violence, across such unexampled savagery, perpetuated  by a whole succession of American leaders-one thinks of this, and is simultaneously appalled, exhilarated,  and given hope. Is it possible that out of a persecuted, defamed, all but destroyed people should arise the Suffering Servant of our own oracles; possible that salvation for the heinous, blood-ridden West should once again come from the East-and this, not in times of social normalcy, but across the curtain of blood that we wove and suspended between that people and ourselves, upon which they were stretched and racked, day after day, the people to whom Pascal surely had reference, those \"crucified until the end of time\"?',\n",
       "    'In a universal catastrophe, it is surely presumptuous  to single out one element, one tradition, as having \"suffered more\" than others. Who can measure such things? They stop the heart in its tracks. At the same time, the religious resistance in the U.S. at the time of the Vietnam  War could not help but take into special account, with a special gratitude, the Vietnamese Buddhist movement. Spiritually speaking, we were closest to them. We drew most fully on their tradition-such a stubborn, unwavering, gentle, persistent, resilient strength! It seems to me far from stretching a point (more likely simply making a point) to see in this Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, and his people, a literal living out of the words of Paul the apostle, writing  to his community, \"... fatiguing labors more abundant, imprisonments  more frequent, lashings innumerable, many threats of death  ... forty  lashes less one ... three  times scourged, once I was stoned,  three times I suffered ship wreck; a night and a day I was adrift on the high seas; in frequent  journey on foot, in perils from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles,  in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder ness, in perils on the sea, in perils from false brethren,  in fatigue and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in fastings, often in cold and nakedness.... And apart from these things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, my solicitude for all our communities!\"',\n",
       "    \"This monk, this suffering servant, who is also a poet, an activist, a teacher, and scholar, suffered a personal loss of the most appalling nature. Young Buddhists were studying at the School of Youth for Social Service, which Nhat Hanh had founded in Saigon early in the '60s. There the students were imbued with the spirit of nonviolent service. On leaving the school, they were to go in groups to help the peasants of the South in whatever way possible-building homes, sowing or harvesting crops, resettling refugees, simple, concrete  projects (we would even say, strikingly evangelical ones). But such a school, in such a time, be came a mortal threat to some of those for whom weapons were the indispensable means of survival or liberation. A period of terrorism  was quickly launched. Students  were killed and maimed in a series of bombings. Finally, one night a horrendous crime unfolded. Five of the students were seized in their dormitories, led to the riverbank nearby and shot. One survived, the others died immediately.\",\n",
       "    'The episode was not widely reported in the world. It was merely another bloody stereotyped incident of war, a spurt of gunfire in the night, a cry, blood quickly shed, quickly erased.  But not  forgotten by a monk who was also the friend of the slain. And so after a time, after grief and loss had had their time, came this gift, this meditation of Nhat Hanh, peaceful and serious, theologically profound, hopeful, light, airy of spirit, a paschal death and victory, a pas sage by water from time to timelessness. Written, one may rightfully presume,  by one whose soul already  is com pounded  of these qualities,  since he conveys them with such skill. Indeed, to him the dead are the quick, and violence is by no means the master, by no means speaks the last word, or stops the mouth of the victim, or indeed finally rules, whatever his boast, his bloodstained  and inflated pretentious.',\n",
       "    'The ironies implicit in the play are enormous and far of reach. We Americans cross the great waters with our techniques of death, supersonic instruments  of appetite, great eyes and ears and maws, a deranged and decapitated sensory apparatus, to smell out and destroy the least lurking evidence of life, health, hope, tradition, faith, family, to tear out the very taproot of existence, to plow up and sow with salt that culture, thousands of years old, which has unfailingly nurtured  a people. \"Let it come down! Let it all come down!\" is the manic whine of the Machine.',\n",
       "    'And lo, coming  across  those same waters (which  we name consciousness, Styx, death, or primordial creation) comes another sort of craft, peopled with spirits, listening, bantering, remembering, laughing. Their wounds  are healed, their memories lucid. They  recall without rancor the method and moment of their death. If there is some thing new about them, it is a quality at once elusive, feisty, a way of standing within death, fronting it, mocking it gently; perhaps best of all, forgiving.',\n",
       "    \"These  spirits are as they were before death. And this is the genius of Thich  Nhat Hanh. His dead have the verisimilitude of the living. They are young, they push shadows back instead  of joining them. They  push the dark back, they create  space, they speak up. Very different indeed from the dimwit ghosts of Virgil's underworld;  more like the robustness,  the crudity, of Dante's  people-those  in hell, chiefly.\",\n",
       "    'And yet with a difference, which continues to escape my mind. It has something to do with a work of authentic Buddhist art, by a monk, about his people. A quality of inwardness, almost of austerity; a patience that escapes our monitors and timepieces; a serenity, caricatured cruelly in the West as stoicism, before death. Something of the twice born, the resurrected, something one sees more and more rarely in the West; now and again in the faces of the old, in a few children, in the cruel ecstasy of street  violence; a light within, struck and then out.',\n",
       "    'Only  here it is a steady flame. It lights  those  bodies, making lamps of them, as they cross the waters in our direction. They  come toward us, and their speech is all of forgiveness, of hope, and joy. Indeed, the play seemed to me a simple act of forgiveness and reconciliation. Are you saying to us, Nhat Hanh,  that the Vietnamese  dead will come back to us who murdered  them? will come, not as ministers of vengeance, but sacramental presences, angels, spirits of new creation?',\n",
       "    'I hope so, with all my heart.',\n",
       "    'And I thank you, Nhat Hanh, monk, medium, necromancer, artist. For your grief, for your long travail, your exile, for the deaf and dumb and uncaring world, for the crucifixion and death of your people. Forgive us.',\n",
       "    'And because the monk Thomas  Merton  said it to you, and your play says it to me, I dare to repeat: Alleluia! We shall see his face!'],\n",

Their arms were also tied behind their backs. Then they took all five of us to the riverbank. We were next to the bamboo grove, supposedly waiting for a boat. Again and again they asked if we were part of the Youth for Social Service, to be absolutely sure. Then, suddenly, they shot us. We four died, but Dinh was only wounded.

On the way to the river, we had to jump over two ditches about a meter  wide, and at the second one, Dinh  fell and they helped him up.

Let me tell you what happened  to our Brother  Duc last year. He was waiting for a civilian plane at a small isolated airport  in the highlands, along with a young American army officer who was waiting for a caribou plane to fly him on a search-and-destroy operation. There was no one else besides  the two of them. The young American struck up a conversation  with Brother Duc, who immediately saw that the man knew nothing about Vietnamese history or culture or the  truth of the conflict in which he was playing a part. He knew only one thing: the Vietcong were his enemy. His duty, as he put it, was to destroy the Vietcong in order  to save the Vietnamese and the free world. Brother  Duc felt so sad. He asked the GI, \"Are you afraid of Vietcong?\" With  that question the soldier leaped to his feet. Duc saw the alarm and suspi cion in his eyes, fear that Duc himself might be a VC. The GI had been told again and again that the VC were very cunning, and wherever he went, he imagined that the VC were present. So he asked rapidly, putting his hands on his gun, \"Are you a VC?\" Brother Duc thought  the question was funny, but he dared not smile. He knew that if he said, in a joking spirit, \"Yes,\" the soldier would shoot him. So he answered, \"No,\" and explained that he was only a professor of religion waiting to catch a plane back to Saigon. Do you know what our Brother Duc said after he had told us about this incident?  He said that if he had been killed then, it would not have been because the American soldier wanted to kill him. The  soldier only wanted to kill Vietcong. He could hate the VC only because he did not really know what the VC were. He imagined that they were wild, cruel monsters that had to be hunted down. In his country the people are fed so much of this that they keep letting their government send men over here to kill and be killed. So, men kill unjustly and in turn are killed unjustly, and it is their own countrymen  who kill them. They  are the ones responsible for the massacre of our people, but they think they have nothing to do with it because it is not they who hold the guns and pull the triggers. Who is really killing us? It is fear, hatred, and prejudice.',\n",

We see those dear to us unjustly destroyed and it is hard to keep our hearts peaceful so that love can survive. Using hatred to fight hatred is the surest way to create even more hatred. Those who create love are fewer and fewer, while those who create hate are more and more. And we are changed by it all.

My hometown, Ben Tre, was where the energy and fervor of the revolution were in constant movement, much like the swift, deep water of the Tien  Giang River on its way to the sea. Fortunately, my family realized early on the necessity of love and encouraged me to follow my inclina tion for a monk's life. I went to the Buddhist Institutes of Giac Sanh, Tra Vinh, and later An Quang. Then I took up social studies and fieldwork. When  I worked hard, it was not because I had any illusion about my ability to change the situation. That  would have been like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a cup of water.

Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process. Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance, but a non violent one cannot  use such blind sources of energy, for they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself. Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.',\n",
       "    'The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and \\'70s arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside,  and people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people\\'s survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and maintain the strictest  neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as \"pro-communist  neutralists.\" Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North  Vietnamese spoke for the communist  bloc and the South  Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist  bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a \"victory\" by either side.  During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children raising  their  bare hands against barbed  wire; students confronting military  police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and holding bayonets; young women running  through  clouds of tear gas with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently; monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.',\n",
       "    'Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for independence from the French,  and they won the support  of their countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive resistance and undertake  positive efforts to over come the war and the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue  and Danang learned  that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those cities brought  their family altars-the most sacred objects in their homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition  to oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying they used religion for political  purposes,  but I do not agree. They  were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront  the violence. This was not a political act; it was an act of love.',\n",
       "    'Fasting, the method used most by Mahatma Gandhi to help India in its struggle for independence,  was also used in Vietnam. Sometimes,  thousands of people fasted, and other times, a single person fasted. We fasted as prayer to purify our hearts, consolidate our will, and arouse awareness and compassion in others. When Thich Tri Quang fasted for 100 days, those who passed the Duy Tan Clinic were jarred into awareness, and compassion was born in them. As a result, they felt compelled  to meet, talk, and plan, thereby escalating the struggle. Thich Tri Quang had not planned to fast. He had to fast.',\n",

Antiwar songs were sung in streets and classrooms, and antiwar literature became the largest category of books sold in Vietnam, even infiltrating army units. Look Back at Your Homeland, Only Death Allows You to Speak Out, and Lotus in a Sea of Fire sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Our literature was considered  dangerous  by both sides. One book of poems, Let Us Pray so the White Dove Will Be with Us, was submitted to the Ministry of Information, and only two of the sixty poems in it were approved. A group of students published it anyway, and within a week, all copies were sold. In Hue, a policeman saw a copy in a bookstore and warned the owner, \"Hide  this and only bring it out when someone asks for it.\" Sister Cao Ngoc Phuong was arrested  in Hue for transporting antiwar books, and, before I left the country, I was also arrested and imprisoned for a few days in Bao Loc for \"antiwar\" activities, although I was charged only with the crime of listening  to Hanoi Radio.

People thought we Buddhists were trying to seize power, but we had no interest in power. We only wanted to stop the slaughter. The voice of the Viet namese people-8O percent  Buddhists-was lost in the melee of shooting and bombs. But we realized  that the means and the end are one, and we never employed any kind of action  that  betrayed  our commitment to nonviolence.',\n",

Madame Nhu described it as a \"barbecue.\" By burning himself, Thich  Quang Duc awakened the world to the suffering of the war and the persecution of the Buddhists. When someone stands up to violence in such a courageous way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc\\'s act expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way, including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be \"a torch in the dark night.\"',\n",
       "    'Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She left behind letters to the Presidents  of North  and South Vietnam, imploring  them to stop the fighting.  She wrote one letter to me: \"Thay, don\\'t worry too much. We will have peace soon.\" Nhat Chi Mai moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of love.',\n",
       "    \"I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the hearts of the oppressors and call the world's attention  to the suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination,  courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots on his body with moxa incense as he takes the 250 vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to helping living beings. If he were to say this while sitting comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered  while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing  this kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and mind.\",\n",
       "    \"The  Vietnamese   monks,  nuns,  and  laypeople  who burned themselves were saying with all their strength and determination that they were willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy,  but to create.  Suicide  is an act of self-destruction based on the inability to cope with life's difficulties. In Buddhism, self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions  of the precepts. Those  who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance,  fanaticism, oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that  lay within the hearts of their fellow men and women.\",\n",
       "    'We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself. Then  everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence. Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors and students followed suit. There  were labor strikes at the harbors and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and university students  boycotted  classes and examinations. Draftees refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals. The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas, grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these nonviolent efforts.',\n",
       "    'Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement, damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned  or killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians, workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously wounded-all  because they refused to take sides in the war. In a memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and neutrality: \"Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways of working for the people of Vietnam.\"',\n",

In our struggle in Vietnam, we did our best to remain true to our principles.

In the past four days, five Vietnamese have immolated themselves, some of them leaving behind messages explaining that their actions were in protest against U.S. policy in South Vietnam. During my short visit to your country,  I have repeatedly been asked why the Vietnamese people seem to have become so strongly anti-American.',\n",
       "    'I wish, first  of all, to assure you that  I am not  anti American. Indeed, it is precisely because I do have a great respect and admiration for America that I have undertaken this long voyage to your country,  a voyage that entails great personal risk for me upon my return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this risk willingly because I have faith that if the American public can begin to understand some thing of what the Vietnamese  people feel about what is happening in our country, much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery being endured by both our peoples might be eliminated.',\n",
       "    \"The demonstrations, self-immolations, and protests that we are witnessing in Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frustrations that the Vietnamese people feel at being so effectively excluded from participation in the determination of their country's future. Eighty years of French domination over Vietnam were ended by a long and bloody struggle waged and won by the Vietnamese people against overwhelming odds. During the twelve years since independence, most Vietnamese have remained without a voice in the nation's destiny, and this at a time when the nation is being subjected to a destructive force far surpassing anything ever before seen in our country. If anti-Americanism seems to be emerging  as a focus for some of the recent protests,  it is because the Vietnamese people recognize that it is really only the awesome U.S. power that enables the Saigon governments to rule without a popular mandate and to follow policies contrary  to the aspirations of the Vietnamese  people. This  is not  the independence for which the Vietnamese people fought so valiantly.\",\n",
       "    'The war in Vietnam today pits brother against brother, the Vietcong against the supporters of the Saigon government. Both sides claim to represent the Vietnamese people, but in reality neither  side does.

       "    'Every escalation  of the war, every new contingent of U.S. troops confirms these charges and wins new recruits to the Vietcong,  for the overwhelming  majority  of the Vietnamese people now thirst desperately for peace and oppose any further expansion of the war. They see clearly that the present  policy of constant  escalation only puts peace ever further into the future and merely guarantees an even greater destruction of Vietnamese society. There  are now more than 300,000 Americans in my country, most of them knowing and caring little about our customs and practices and many of them involved in destroying Vietnamese people and property.',\n",
       "    'This  creates friction  which generously  feeds the anti American propaganda,  and the fact that the war kills far more innocent  peasants than it does Vietcong is a tragic reality of life in the Vietnamese countryside. Those  who escape death by bombings must often abandon  their destroyed villages and seek shelter  in refugee camps where life is even more miserable than it was in the villages. In general, these people do not blame the Vietcong for their plight. It is the men in the planes, who drop death and destruction  from the skies, who appear to them to be their enemies. How can they see it otherwise?',\n",

       "    \"Vietnam that appear to be most devoted to the U.S.'s wishes for Vietnam's future. But these elements have never been viewed by the Vietnamese people as their spokesmen. Diem was not, nor were Diem's successors. Thus,  it has been the U.S.'s antipathy to popular government in South Vietnam, together  with its hope for an ultimate  military solution, that has not only contradicted the deepest aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but actually undermined the very objective for which we believe Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.\",\n",
       "    \"To us, America's first objective is to have an anticommunist, or at least a non-communist, Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese people's objective is to have peace. They dislike communism, but they dislike war even more, especially after twenty years of fighting and bitterness which has rotted the very fabric of Vietnamese life. Equally important, we now see clearly that continuance of the war is more likely to spread communism in Vietnam than to contain it. The new social class of military officers and commerfants that has been created as a direct result of the U.S. involvement, a class of sycophants who support the war for crass economic reasons, are not the people to whom Washington should listen if it sincerely wishes to hear the voice of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people reject with scorn this corrupt  and self-seeking class that cares neither  for Vietnam nor for the great ideals of America, but thinks only of its own interests.\",\n",
       "    'The opinion is often expressed that there is no alternative to the present U.S. policy in Vietnam, neither on the political nor the military side. The non-communist alternatives to a military dictatorship  are said to be too fragmented  to offer a stable alternative, and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal  are considered  unfeasible  because it is feared that the Vietcong will take over the country by terror.',\n",
       "    'The Vietnamese people recognize both of these dangers, but they also recognize  the utter  futility  of the present course and the catastrophic effects that it is having on our society. Furthermore, we do not agree that there is no alternative to a military dictatorship. The force of Vietnamese nationalism is such an alternative. Indeed, this is the sole force that can prevent the complete disintegration  of South Vietnam, and it is the force around which all Vietnamese can unite. But nationalism cannot attain its effective potential in the present Vietnamese political climate, where opposition to the government invites open persecution upon oneself and identification with it discredits one in the eyes of the people.',\n",
       "    \"More  than a decade of this atmosphere has served to drive many of the Vietnamese nationalists into the National Liberation Front, and many others of them into an ominous silence. Last year, an effort by a prominent group of nationalists  to circulate a mild petition  requesting  peace negotiations  between the South Vietnamese government and the NLF was so brutally attacked by the government that we are not likely to hear from them soon again, de spite their having attained some 5,000 signers in less than three days' time.\",\n",
       "    'Today, the means for nationalist expression rests mainly with the Vietnamese Buddhists, who alone command sufficient popular support  to spearhead a protest for popular government. This  is not a new role for Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the Vietnamese  peasants, Buddhism and nationalism are inseparably entwined. The historic accident that made the popularization of Christianity in Vietnam coincident with France subjugation of Vietnam created this image.',\n",
       "    'The repression of our faith by the French and by President Diem strengthened it. And today, when the Buddhist attempt  to give expression to the long pent-up wishes of the submerged and ignored Vietnamese masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the Vietnamese army, the Vietnamese people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly see whose action reflects our national heritage and whose action betrays this heritage.',\n",
       "    \"Thus, although  the Vietnamese  people may lose skirmishes because they have no foreign sources of support, the crude victories of the Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their credibility while confirming the Vietcong's propaganda claim that the government cares nothing about the people. The Buddhist efforts are designed not to weaken Vietnam's resistance but to create a genuine will to resist.\",\n",
       "    'Differences do exist among the Buddhists, the Catholics, and the other sects, but they would not be insurmountable if there were a climate in Vietnam that encouraged unity. But there are those who see a unified, popular, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a threat to themselves. Such persons help to sow disunity and then use the disunity which they create as a pretext for retaining power. No, we do not accept the evaluation  that there is no alternative to the present type of government.',\n",
       "    \"The second argument offered for continuing the present U.S. policy is that a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal would merely leave Vietnam to the communists. This argument we must also reject. The Vietcong grow stronger  because of the mistakes made by Saigon, not because of its communist ideology or its terror. If South Vietnam could achieve a government clearly responsive to the basic aspirations of the Vietnamese people and truly independent, there would no longer be any basis for popular support for the rebels. Indeed,  the rebels would have lost their reason to rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to continue, the Vietnamese people would have the will to resist it, for they could identify it as being hostile to Vietnamese nationalism, contrary to the people's longing for peace and reconstruction, and therefore of foreign inspiration.\",\n",
       "    'Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam. Although  I am not a politician  and cannot therefore suggest every detail of a satisfactory settlement, the general direction that such a solution must take is quite clear to me and to many of the Vietnamese people. It does not involve the U.S. in any negotiations  with Hanoi, Peking, or the NLF. To the Vietnamese people, such talks, if necessary, are the proper province of Vietnamese officials rather than of Washington.',\n",

       "    '3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal actually beginning to take place as a sign of sin cerity.',\n",
       "    '4. A clear statement  by the U.S. of its desire to help the Vietnamese  people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to implement  this statement, such as a refusal to support one group over another.',\n",

       "    'The plan is not perfect, for the question remains of how the U.S. can be sure that the South Vietnamese government and the Vietcong would cooperate in such a venture. Insofar as the South Vietnamese government is concerned, the past statements  of Premier  Ky have clearly indicated his unwillingness to seek a peaceful end to the war. In fact, it has been the contradiction between the aggressive words of Saigon and the peaceful statements of Washington that has so discredited the so-called U.S. peace offensive of last winter. The  withdrawal of the U.S. support  for Ky may thus be a necessary precondition for implementation of such a plan.',\n",
       "    \"It is obviously not possible to predict the response of the Vietcong to such a program, but the installation of a popular government in South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the beginning of an American withdrawal, would so undercut the Vietcong's position that it is likely to have no alternative but to cooperate.\",\n",
       "    \"Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace. To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns. America's history suggests that she has the potential  to provide the world this leadership.\"],\n",

       "    'In Vietnam, we take great risks publishing antiwar poems. Buddhists who have protested the war have been arrested and exiled, and are now being killed in Danang. Because of this great risk, the Buddhists who demonstrated this Spring were reluctant to advocate openly an end to the war through negotiations; instead, they called for elections and democracy. We are in an impossible dilemma. If we openly call for peace, we are identified with the communists and the government will try to suppress us. If we criticize the communists, we find ourselves aligned with those Vietnamese who have been propagandists  for the Americans for years and whose words against communism are soiled and discredited because they have been paid to say them. To be honorably anticommunist has been to remain silent, and, being silent, we have been labeled as innocent of the dangers of communism. But we are not. We are well aware of the restrictions on Buddhism in the North. We have studied  what happened  in China.  We know there  is no place for spirituality in Marxism. We are ready to under take a peaceful political struggle with the communists, if only the destruction of the war can be stopped. We are confident  that the South .Vietnamese can protect  themselves from communist  domination  if we are allowed to carry out our political lives in peace.',\n",
       "    'The  tragedy of American policy is that it has made such a peaceful political struggle very difficult. The Americans could have helped in reconstructing the country peacefully if they had cooperated with and strengthened the Buddhists and others who had the respect of the people. Instead, they have tried to divide the Buddhists to prevent them from becoming an organized force, and this has been disastrous. Catholicism came to Vietnam with the French, and the Catholic leaders, backed by the U.S., were objects of suspicion for most of the people. The Buddhist tradition is closely linked with nationalism, and it is unthinkable to the broad mass of people that the Buddhists would betray them to a foreign  power. At the same time, Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic in character-there are Catholic priests who are closer to us on the question of peace than some of the older, more conservative Buddhist priests. (A few months  ago, eleven Catholic  priests issued a strong statement calling for peace, and they were attacked by the Catholic leaders.)',\n",
       "    'Now the U.S. has become too afraid of the communists to allow a peaceful confrontation with them to take place, and when you are afraid, you cannot win. Sending 300,000',\n",
       "    'American troops to Vietnam and bombing the countryside have only caused the communists to grow stronger. American military operations have killed and wounded more innocent peasants than Vietcong, and the Americans are blamed and hated for this. The peasants are not violently antagonistic to the Vietcong. The strong anticommunists are mostly people in the cities who fear the loss of their property, cars, businesses, and homes, and rely on the foreign army to protect them. The American soldiers, moreover, do not understand the Vietnamese. GIs make thousands of small mistakes every day that offend Vietnamese people. And the continual roaring overhead of U.S. planes on their way to drop bombs makes the people sick and angry.',\n",
       "    'So it is understandable that the villagers distrust those who are connected with the South Vietnamese government and the Americans. Along with others, I helped organize a Buddhist School of Youth for Social Service, and we have trained thousands of young people to work at community development projects in the villages. We refuse to accept money from the government or the American Military Assistance Group. We go into the villages with nothing but our own robes, and we are warmly welcomed. The  peasants we work with tell us that the government officials assigned to \"assist\" them keep thousands of piasters a month for themselves and do nothing for them. They have come to dislike the Vietcong and fear the Americans, whose bombs continue to fall down on them.',\n",

Venerable Thich Tri Quang believes we may attain peace indirectly by means of political maneuvering and through elections. He is a man of action, courage, and intelligence, whose life is exemplary. But other Buddhists are trying to create a new Buddhist path emphasizing ways of helping the people who live on the land. I myself doubt that much will be gained by indirect political maneuvering against the government and the Catholics, as long as the U.S. is determined to continue the war. Underlying  our struggles with the government  in Danang and other cities is the unstated question of whether the war will go on, and this only the U.S. can decide. I believe the most effective thing we can do is advocate peace, however dangerous that may be, by telling the world that we do not accept this war, that the communists are growing stronger every day it continues to be fought,  and that a cease-fire  must be arranged  with the Vietcong as soon as possible. Then we would welcome the help of Americans in the peaceful reconstruction of our country. Only America has the capability of stopping this war, which is destroying not only our lives, but our culture and everything of human value.',\n",

I wrote these poems first for myself; when I read them I can regain the state of intense  feeling in which I composed them.

A few days after they were published last year, government police came to seize them from the bookstores, but by then they had all been sold.

In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going in the direction  of non violence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed in that direction.',\n",
       "    'Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even soldiers. Some army generals, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid killing innocent people; this is a kind of nonviolence. To help soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with them. If we divide reality into two camps-the violent and the nonviolent-and stand in one camp while attacking  the other,  the world will never have peace. We will always blame and condemn those we feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without recognizing  the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on ourselves and also work with those we condemn if we want to have a real impact. It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as enemies, even  those  who act violently. We have  to approach  them  with love in our  hearts  and do our  best to help them move in a direction  of nonviolence. If we work for peace out of anger, we will never succeed. Peace is not an end.  It can never  come  about  through non-peaceful means. When  we protest against a war, we may assume that we are a peaceful  person,  a representative of peace,  but this might  not be the case. If we look deeply, we will observe that  the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have been living. We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves  and others, therefore we are co-responsible: \"Because I have been like this, they are like that.\" A more holistic approach  is the way of \"interbeing\": \"This  is like this, because that is like that.\" This  is the way of understanding and love. With  this insight, we can see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go to a demonstration and say, \"This war is unjust, destructive,  and not worthy of our great nation.\" This is far more effective than angrily condemning others. Anger always accelerates the damage.',\n",

To create fundamental change, we, the members of society, have to transform ourselves. If we want real peace, we have to demonstrate our love and understanding so that those responsible for making decisions can learn from us.',\n",
       "    'All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry and frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is capable of understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there is a bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara who has 1,000 arms and 1,000 hands, and has an eye in the palm of each hand. One thousand hands represent action, and the eye in each hand represents understanding.  When you understand  a situation  or a person, any action you do will help and will not cause more suffering.

With  the eye of understanding, we will not say things to make the other person suffer. Blaming and arguing are forms of violence. When we speak, if we suffer greatly, our words may be bitter, and that will not help anyone. We have to learn to calm our selves and become a flower before we speak. This is \"the art of loving speech.\"',\n",
       "    'Listening is also a deep practice. The  bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara has a deep talent for listening. In Chinese, his name means \"listening to the cries of the world.\" We have to listen in a way that we understand the suffering of others. We have to empty ourselves and leave space so we can listen well. If we breathe in and out to refresh and empty ourselves, we will be able to sit still and listen to the person who is suffering. When she is suffering, she needs someone to listen attentively without judging or reacting. If she cannot find someone in her family, she may go to a psychotherapist. Just by listening deeply, we already alleviate a great  deal of her pain. This  is an important practice  of peace. We have to listen in our families and in our communities. We have to listen to everyone, especially those we consider our enemies. When we show our capacity of listening and understanding, the other person will also listen to us, and we will have a chance to tell him of our pain. This is the beginning of healing.',\n",

If we see deeply into the nature of interbeing, that all things \"inter-are,\" we will stop blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with everyone.',\n",

Without our doing anything, things can sometimes go more smoothly  just because of our peaceful presence. In a small boat when a storm comes, if one person remains solid and calm, others will not panic, and the boat is more likely to stay afloat. In many circumstances, non-action can help a lot. A tree merely breathes, waves its leaves and branches, and tries to stay fresh. But if the tree were not there, we could not be here. The  tree's non-action is fundamental to our welbeing. If we can learn to live the way a tree does-staying fresh and solid, peaceful and calm-even if we do not do many things, others will benefit from our non-action, our presence. We can also practice non-action  in the domain of speech. Words can create understanding and mutual acceptance, or they can cause others to suffer. Sometimes it is best not to say anything. This is a book on nonviolent social action, but we must also discuss nonviolent  non-action. If we really want to help the world, the practice of non-action is essential.\",\n",

If a monk, for example, sees a woman drowning and does not want to touch her because of his precepts, he will violate the most fundamental principle of life.

If we are still upset, we can go for walking meditation, mindful of each slow step and each breath  we take. By cultivating peace within,  we bring about  peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in ourselves is to minimize the numbers of wars between this and that feeling, or this and that perception, and we can then have real peace with others as well, including  the members of our own family.',\n",

It may take ten years, or longer. If you wait until  the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too late. A this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial moment, even if you know that nonviolence  is better than violence, if your understanding is only intellectual and not in your whole being, you will not act nonviolently.

       "   'quotes': ['Immediately after ordering the ground attack on Iraq, in February 1991, President  Bush addressed his nation, saying, \"Whatever you are doing at this moment, please stop and pray for our soldiers in the Gulf. God Bless the United States  of America.\"  I suspect  that at the same moment many Moslems were also praying to their God to protect Iraq and the Iraqi soldiers. How could God know which nation to support? Many people pray to God because they want God  to fulfill some of their needs. If they want to have a picnic, they may ask God for a clear, sunny day. At the same time, farmers who need more rain might pray for the opposite. If the weather is clear, the picknickers may say, \"God is on our side; he answered our prayers.\" But if it rains, the farmers will say that God heard  their  prayers. This is the way we usually pray.',\n",

       "    'the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\" Those who work for peace must have a peaceful  heart. When you have a peaceful heart, you are the child of God. But many who work for peace are not at peace. They still have anger and frustration, and their work is not really peaceful. We cannot say that they belong to the Kingdom of God.',\n",
       "    'To preserve peace, our hearts must be at peace with the world, with our brothers and our sisters. When we try. To overcome evil with evil, we are not working for peace. If you say, \"Saddam Hussein is evil. We have to prevent him from continuing  to be evil,\" and if you then use the same means he has been using, you are exactly like him. Trying to overcome evil with evil is not the way to make peace.',\n",
       "    'Jesus also said, \"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ... whosoever shall say, \\'Thou fool,’ shalt be in danger of hell fire.\"',\n",
       "    \"Jesus did not say that if you are angry with your brother, you will be put in a place called hell. He said that if you are angry with your brother, you are already in hell. Anger is hell. He also said that you don't need to kill with your body to be put in jail. You need only to kill in your mind and you are already there.\",\n",
       "    \"In the Persian  Gulf, many people practiced  killing in their minds-Iraqi, American, French, British, and other soldiers. They knew that if they didn't kill, the enemy sol diers would kill them, so they used sandbags to represent their enemy, and holding their bayonets firmly, they ran, shouted, and plunged  the  bayonets  into  the sandbags. They  practiced killing day and night in their hearts and minds. The damage caused by that kind of practice is huge. I happened to see a few seconds of that kind of practice on TV. Even if President Bush had not given the order for a land offensive, a lot of damage was already being done in the minds and hearts of one million people in the Gulf. Those kinds of wounds last for a long time and are transmitted  to future generations. If you train yourself every day to kill during the day and then dream of killing during the night because you have spent so much time concentrating on that, the damage is deep. If you survive, you will bear that kind of scar for many years. This is a real tragedy. We usually count  bodies to measure the damage from a war, but we don't count these kinds of wounds in the hearts and minds of so many soldiers. We have to see the real long-term damage that war causes. Soldiers live in hell day and night, even before they go into the battlefield, and even after they return home.\",\n",
       "    'We may think of peace as the absence of war, that if the great powers would reduce their weapons arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we will see our own minds-our own prejudices, fears, and ignorance.  Even if we transport all the  bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of the bombs are still here-in our hearts and minds-and, sooner or later, we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To start a war and give the opportunity to one million men and women to practice killing day and night in their hearts is to plant many, many seeds of war-anger, frustration, and the fear of being killed.

       "    'This is Jesus\\' teaching about revenge. \"When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When he wants to borrow something from you, lend it to him. How many Christians actually practice this? There  is a story about an American soldier who was taking a Japanese prisoner during World War II. While walking together, the American discovered that the Japanese soldier spoke English and that he had been a Christian before he abandoned his faith. So he asked, \"Why did you abandon Christianity? It is an excellent religion,\" and the Japanese man said, \"I could not become a soldier and continue  to be a Christian. I don\\'t think a good Christian  can become a soldier and kill another person.\" He understood this passage from Matthew. There  must be ways to solve our conflicts without having to resort to killing. We must focus our attention  on this. We have to find ways to help people get out of difficult situations, situations of conflict, without having to kill.',\n",

       "    'This is nondiscrimination. When you pray only for your own picnic and not for the farmers who need the rain, you are doing the opposite  of what Jesus taught. Jesus said, \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you...\" When we look deeply into our anger, we see that the person we call our enemy is also suffering. As soon as we see that, we have the capacity of accepting and having compassion for him. Jesus called this \"loving your enemy.\" When we are able to love our enemy, he or she is no longer our enemy. The  idea of \"enemy\" vanishes and is replaced by the no tion of someone suffering a great deal who needs our com passion. Doing  this is sometimes  easier than we might think, but we need to practice. If we read the Bible but don\\'t practice, it will not help much.',\n",
       "    '\"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" Everyone makes mistakes. If we are mindful, we see that  some  of our  actions  in the  past may have caused others to suffer, and some actions of others  have made us suffer. We want to be forgiving. We want to begin anew. \"You, my brother or sister, have wronged me in the past. I now understand that it was because you were suffering and did not see clearly. I no longer feel anger towards you.\" That  kind of forgiveness is the fruit of awareness. When you are mindful you can see all the causes that led the other person to make you suffer. When you see this, forgiveness  and release arise naturally. You can\\'t  force yourself to forgive. Only when you understand  what has happened can you have compassion for the other  person and forgive him or her.',\n",

You are more than that. You may have lost just a few hundred American lives, but you also suffered from the Gulf War in many other ways. The deaths of so many Iraqi soldiers and civilians are also casualties that America suffered,  because their death was your country\\'s work. When President Bush said, \"God bless the United States of America,\" he was not paying enough attention to the lives of non-Americans.

You cannot plunge a bayonet into a person without first transforming yourself into a beast. On the other side, one million Iraqi soldiers were practicing the same. One and a half million solders were practicing violence, hatred, and fear, and the American public supported  them to do so. They thought that this war was somehow clean, quick, and moral.

Then, in workshops, we can discuss strategies for tree-watching and also principles for appreciating human beings, even those who do not look or think exactly as we do.

The project was called, \"When blood is shed, we all suffer.\" At that time, not many people knew about the presence of the boat people, and the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore would not allow them to land on their shores. The practice was to push the boat people back out to sea so they would die, and those on land would not have to deal with them.',\n",

In Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries, thousands of boat people had been sent back and many of them died in the sea. We had to do our work in secret, since the governments of the world did not want to acknowledge the plight of the boat people, and we knew we would be deported from Singapore if we were discovered. We managed to rescue nearly 800 boat people from the Gulf of Siam. On New Year\\'s Eve, I rode out to sea in the small Saigon 200 to talk with the refugees on the larger ships. Using a wireless telephone, I wished them a Happy New Year. After we said good-bye, I headed back to shore, and, in the darkness, a huge wave welled up and drenched me.

When we saw these people, the men were just staring into empty space, and the women and children could not stop crying. One of them told us that they came with two boats. The Malaysian police had given them some water and told them to go to Singapore, where they would be welcomed, but this was not  true-the Singaporeans always towed boats back out into the ocean no matter how dangerous it was for the boat people.',\n",

The  idea came to me to ask the French Embassy to intervene on my behalf so that my visa would be extended for a few more days, enough time to tie up all of these loose ends. And at five minutes before noon, just as the Immigration Department was about to close for the weekend and I would have to leave the country, the ex tension was granted. As long as I live, I will never forget those seconds of sitting meditation,  those breaths, those mindful steps during that night and that morning. Success came when I faced the problem directly. I vowed that if I could not have peace at that moment,  I would never be able to have peace. If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, the kind of peace I might realize in easier times would not mean anything.

In France, he has been eating rice for a year, and he is already beginning  to forget. But when I asked him, he remembered. I could not ask the same question to a French or American child, because they have not had the experience of hunger. It is difficult for people in the West to understand the situation in the Third World. It seems to have nothing to do with their situation. I told the Vietnamese boy that the rice he was eating in France came from Thailand, and that most Thai children do not have rice of such high quality, because the best rice is set aside for ex port to Japan and the West in exchange for foreign currency.',\n",

We try many ways to be awake, but our society still keeps us forgetful. Meditation is to help us remember. There are other  ways to nourish awareness.

Afterwards, I asked him if he had felt uncomfortable, and he said yes. I explained that the reason we eat in silence is to be in touch with the food and the presence of each other. If we talk a lot, we cannot enjoy these things. I asked him if there was some time when he turned off the TV in order to enjoy his dinner  more, and he said yes. Later in the day, I invited him to join us for another  silent meal, and he enjoyed it very much. Society bombards us with so many noises that we have lost our taste for silence. Every time we have a few minutes, we turn on the TV or make a phone call. We do not know how to be ourselves without something  to distract us.

We asked some native mountain people for their help, and two Montagnards  from the Jarai tribe joined us in clearing the forest, cutting trees into lumber, and gathering other materials for construction. They were hard workers, and we were grateful for their assistance. But after working with us only three days, they stopped coming. Without their help, we had many difficulties, as we were not familiar with the ways of the forest. So we walked to their village and asked what had happened. They said, \"Why should we return so soon? You already paid us enough to live for a month! We will come again when we run out of rice.\" At the time, it was a common practice to un derpay the Montagnards,  to avoid just this kind of thing. We had paid them properly, and, surely enough, they stopped coming.',\n",
       "    'Many people criticized the Montagnards for this ethic.',\n",

(2) They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods. (3) The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others. (4) If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasions and the exploitation of others. There may be some validity to each of these points, but if we look closely at the lives of the Montagnards, we will come to understand them, and ourselves, better.',\n",

But they were much more serene and at peace with themselves, nature, and other  people, than almost anyone in the world. I am not suggesting that we all return  to primitive life-styles, but it is important  that we see and appreciate the wisdom contained in a life-style like this, a wisdom that those of us immersed  in modernization and economic  growth have lost.',\n",

Some people think they need three or four houses-one on the Riviera, one in New York, one in Tokyo, and perhaps one in Fiji. Others find that a two or three-room hut is quite enough. In fact, if you own a dozen luxurious houses, you may rarely have time to enjoy them. Even when you have the time, you may not know how to sit peacefully in one place. Always seeking distraction-going to restaurants, the theater, or dinner parties, or taking vacations that exhaust you even more, you can't stand being alone and facing yourself directly.\",\n",

We who own just one house barely have the time to live in it. We leave home early in the morning  after a quick breakfast and go off to work, spending an hour in the car or the train and the rest of the day in the office.

Psychotherapists  can try to help, but the cause of this illness is in their way of life.

They did not pollute the air, water, or soil. They used very little fuel and no electricity. They did not own private cars, dishwashers, or electric razors.

They would have seen how expensive food, lodging, electricity, water, clothing, and transportation were. Their civilized countrymen were working all day long and could barely pay for the most basic items they consumed. The Montagnards in the forest did not need to spend any money. If they would have lived and worked in the cities, how would that have helped Vietnam resist foreign intervention?  All they would have learned  is that in the socalled developed nations, resources are used to make bombs and other elaborate weapons, while many citizens live in misery.

As in any therapeutic practice, the patient is placed in an environment that favors the restoration  of harmony. Usually psychotherapists  spend their time observing and then advising their patients. I know of some, however, who, like monks, observe themselves first, recognizing the need to free their own selves from the fears, anxieties, and despair that exist in each of us. Many therapists seem to think that they themselves have no mental problems, but the monk recognizes in himself the susceptibility to fears and anxieties, and to the mental illness that is caused by the inhuman social and economic systems that prevail in today's world.\",\n",

Since this requires an environment favorable to healing, he or she must seek the kind of life-style that is free from destructiveness. Efforts to change the environment and to change the individual are both necessary, but it is difficult to change the environment if individuals are not in a state of equilibrium. From the mental health point of view, efforts for us to recover our humanness should be given priority.\",\n",

The world is sick, and adapting to an unwell environment will not bring real health.

One way to help such a person may be to move him or her to a rural area where he can cultivate the land, grow his own food, wash his clothes in a clear river, and live simply, sharing  the same life as millions of peasants around  the world. For psychotherapy to be effective, we need environmental change, and psychotherapists must participate  in efforts to change the environment. But that is only half their task. The  other half is to help individuals be themselves, not by helping them adapt to an ill environment, but by providing them with the strength  to change it. To tranquilize them is not the way. The explosion of bombs, the burning of napalm, the violent deaths of relatives and neighbors, the pressures  of time, noise, and pollution, the lonely crowds have all been created by the disruptive course of our economic  growth. They  are all sources of mental illness, and they must end. Anything we can do to bring them to an end is preventive medicine. Political activities are not the only means to this end.',\n",

Their work must also prevent others  from becoming  ill. They  are challenged  to safe guard their own humanness. Like others, psychotherapists and monks need to observe first themselves and their own ways of life. If they do, I believe they will seek ways to disengage  themselves  from  the present  economic  systems in order  to help reestablish  harmony and balance in life. Monks and psychotherapists are human beings. We cannot escape mental illness if we do not apply our disciplines to ourselves. Caught in forgetfulness and acquiescence to the status quo, we will gradually become victims of fear, anxiety, and egotism of all kinds.

Unity and diversity interpenetrate each other freely. Unity is diversity, and diversity is unity. This is the principle of interbeing.',\n",

If we want to change the situation, we must begin by being our true selves. To be our true selves means we have to be the forest, the river, and the ozone layer. If we visualize our selves as the forest, we will experience the hopes and fears of the trees. If we don't do this, the forests will die, and we will lose our chance for peace. When we understand  that we inter-are with the trees, we will know that it is up to us to make an effort to keep the trees alive.

       "    'If we change our daily lives-the way we think, speak, and act-we change the world. The  best way to take care of the environment is to take care of the environmentalist. Many Buddhist teachings help us understand our inter connectedness with our Mother,  the Earth.  One of the deepest is the Diamond Sutra, which is written in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and his senior disciple, Subhuti. It begins  with  this  question  by Subhuti: \"If daughters and sons of good families wish to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind, what should they rely on and what should they do to master their thinking?\" This is the same as asking, \"If I want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and principles should I use?\"',\n",
       "    'The  Buddha answers, \"We have to do our best to help every living being cross the ocean of suffering. But after all beings have arrived at the shore of liberation, no being at all has been carried to the other shore. If you are still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a life span, you are not an authentic bodhisattva.\" Self, person, living being, and life span are four notions that pre vent us from seeing reality.',\n",
       "    'Life is one. We do not need to slice it into pieces and call this or that piece a \"self.\" What we call a self is made only of non-self elements. When  we look at a flower, for example, we may think that it is different from \"non-flower\" things. But when we look more deeply, we see that everything in the cosmos is in that flower. Without  all of the non-flower elements-sunshine, clouds, earth, minerals, heat, rivers, and consciousness-a flower cannot be. That is why the Buddha teaches that the self does not exist. We have to discard all distinctions between self and non-self. How can anyone work to protect the environment without this insight?',\n",
       "    'The second notion that prevents us from seeing reality is the notion of a person, a human being. We usually discriminate between humans and non-humans, thinking that we are more important than other species. But since we humans are made of non-human elements, to protect our selves we have to protect all of the non-human  elements. There is no other way. If you think, \"God created man in His own image and He created other  things for man to use,\" you are already making the discrimination that man is more  important than  other  things.  When  we see that humans have no self, we see that to take care of the environment (the non-human elements) is to take care of humanity. The best way to take good care of men and women so that they can be truly healthy and happy is to take care of the environment.',\n",
       "    'I know ecologists who are not happy in their families. They work hard to improve the environment, partly to escape family life. If someone is not happy within himself, how can he help the environment? That is why the Buddha teaches that to protect the non-human elements is to protect humans, and to protect humans is to protect non-human elements.',\n",
       "    'The third notion we have to break through is the notion of a living being. We think that we living beings are different from inanimate objects, but according to the principle of interbeing, living beings are comprised of non-living being elements. When  we look into  ourselves,  we see minerals and all  other non-living-being elements. Why discriminate against what we call inanimate? To protect living beings, we must protect the stones, the soil, and the oceans. Before the atomic bomb was dropped  on Hiroshima, there  were many beautiful stone  benches in the parks. As the Japanese were rebuilding their city, they dis covered that these stones were dead, so they carried them away and buried them. Then  they brought in live stones. Do not think these things are not alive. Atoms are always moving. Electrons move at nearly the speed of light. Ac cording to the teaching of Buddhism,  these atoms and stones are consciousness itself. That is why discrimination by living beings against non-living beings should be dis carded.',\n",
       "    'The  last notion is that of a life span. We think that we have been alive since a certain point in time and that prior to that moment, our life did not exist. This distinction between life and non-life is not correct. Life is made of death, and death  is made of life. We have to accept  death;  it makes life possible. The cells in our body are dying every day, but we never think to organize funerals for them. The death of one cell allows for the birth of another. Life and death are two aspects of the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so that others may live. This deep meditation brings forth non-fear, non-anger, and non-despair, the strengths we need for our work. With non-fear, even when we see that a problem is huge, we will not burn out. We will know how to make small, steady steps. If those who work to protect the environment  contemplate  these four notions, they will know how to be and how to act.',\n",
       "    'In another Buddhist text, the Avatamsaka (\\'\\'Adorning the\\nBuddha with Flowers\\'? Sutra, the Buddha further elaborates his insights concerning our \"interpenetration\" with our environment. Please meditate with me on the \"Ten Penetrations\":',\n",
       "    'The first is, \"All worlds penetrate a single pore. A single pore penetrates all worlds.\" Look deeply at a flower. It may be tiny, but the sun, the clouds, and everything else in the cosmos penetrates it. Nuclear physicists say very much the same thing: one electron is made by all electrons; one electron is in all electrons.',\n",
       "    'The second penetration  is, \"All living beings penetrate one body. One body penetrates  all living beings.\" When you kill a living being, you kill yourself and everyone else as well.',\n",
       "    'The third is, \"Infinite time penetrates one second. One second penetrates infinite time.\" A ksana is the shortest period of time, actually much shorter than a second.',\n",
       "    'The fourth penetration is, \"All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching.  One teaching penetrates all Buddhist teachings.\" As a young monk, I had the opportunity to learn that Buddhism is made of non-Buddhist elements. So, whenever I study Christianity or Judaism, I find the Buddhist elements in them, and vice versa. I always respect non-Buddhist teachings. All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching,  and one teaching  penetrates all Buddhist teachings. We are free.',\n",
       "    'The fifth penetration is, \"Innumerable spheres enter one sphere. One sphere enters innumerable spheres.\" A sphere is a geographical  space. Innumerable spheres  penetrate into one particular area, and one particular area enters into innumerable spheres. It means that when you destroy one area, you destroy every area. When you save one area, you save all areas. A student asked me, \"Thay,  there  are so many urgent problems, what should I do?\" I said, \"Take one thing and do it very deeply and carefully, and you will be doing everything at the same time.\"',\n",
       "    'The sixth penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate one organ. One organ penetrates all sense organs\"-eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. To take care of one means\\nto take care of many. To take care of your eyes means to take care of the eyes of innumerable living beings.',\n",
       "    'The seventh penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate non-sense  organs. Non-sense  organs penetrate  all sense organs.\"  Not only do non-sense organs penetrate  sense organs, they also penetrate non-sense organs. There  is no discrimination. Sense organs are made of non-sense-organ elements. That is why they penetrate  non-sense  organs. This helps us remember the  teaching of the  Diamond Sutra.',\n",
       "    'The eighth penetration  is, \"One perception  penetrates all perceptions. All perceptions penetrate one perception.\" If your perception is not accurate, it will influence all other perceptions  in yourself and others. Suppose a bus driver has an incorrect  perception. We know what may happen. One perception penetrates all perceptions.',\n",
       "    'The  ninth penetration  is, \"Every sound penetrates one sound. One sound penetrates every sound.\" This is a very deep teaching. If we understand  one sound or one word, we can understand all.',\n",
       "    'The  tenth penetration is, \"All times penetrate one time. One time penetrates all times-past, present, and future. In one second, you can find the past, present, and future.\" In the past, you can see the present and the future. In the present, you can find the past and future. In the future, you can find the past and present. They \"inter-contain\" each other.  Space contains  time, time contains  space. In the teaching of interpenetration, one determines the other, the other determines this one. When we realize our nature of interbeing, we will stop blaming and killing, because we know that we inter-are.',\n",
       "    \"Interpenetration is an important teaching,  but it still suggests that things outside of one another penetrate into each other. Interbeing is a step forward. We are already inside, so we don't have to enter. In contemporary nuclear physics, people talk about implicit order and explicit order. In the explicit order, things exist outside of each otherthe table outside of the flower, the sunshine outside of the cypress tree. In the implicit  order, we see that  they are inside each other-the sunshine  inside the cypress tree. Interbeing is the implicit order. To practice mindfulness and to look deeply into the nature of things is to discover the true nature of interbeing. There we find peace and develop the strength to be in touch with everything. With this understanding, we can easily sustain the work of loving and caring for the Earth and for each other for a long time.\"],\n",

The  earth beneath the tree's shadow was unusually cool. Its bark was as hard as rock; if you pressed a fingernail against it, pain ran through  your finger. Its branches  held tens of thou sands of nests, sheltering  hundreds of thousands of birds, both large and small.\",\n",

The moon was very bright; the stars were very bright. The  tiny bird cried throughout the night. Its cry was neither tragic nor bold; it was a cry of surprise and strangeness.

When it flew, its wingspan was vast, and it moved slowly and very quietly. Often it flew to faraway places where white waterfalls tumbled  day and night like the majestic  breath  of earth and sky.',\n",
       "    'Sometimes the  bird did not  return  for several  days. When  it returned, it lay in its nest all day and night, thoughtfully and quietly. Its two eyes were very bright; they never lost the look of surprise they had from the beginning.',\n",
       "    \"Now, in the ancient forest of Dai Lao, a hermit's small hut stood on the slope of a hill. There a monk had lived for almost fifty years. The bird often flew across Dai Lao forest; from time to time it saw the monk walking slowly down the path to the spring,  holding a water  jug in his hand. One day, smoke gently lingered over the roof of the humble hut and an atmosphere of warmth surrounded the hill. The bird saw two monks together on the path leading from the spring to the hut, speaking as they walked. That night the bird remained in Dai Lao forest. Concealed in the branches of a tree, the bird watched the light of the fire flickering inside the hut, where the two monks conversed through the night.\",\n",
       "    'The  bird flew high, high over the ancient  forest. For several days it flew back and forth in the sky without landing. Below stood the great tree in the ancient forest; below, the creatures of the mountain and forest were concealed by grass, bushes, and trees. Since the day the bird listened to the exchange between the two monks, its bewilderment grew. Where have I come from and where will I go? How many thousands of years will the great tree stand?',\n",
       "    'The  bird had heard the two monks speak about Time.',\n",
       "    'What is Time? Why has Time brought us here, and why will it take us away? The  nut that a bird eats has its own delicious nature. How can I find out the nature of Time? The  bird wanted to pick up a small piece of Time and lie quietly with it in its nest for several days to examine its nature. Even if it took months or years to examine, the bird was willing.',\n",
       "    'The  bird flew high, high over the ancient forest. It was like a round balloon drifting in nothingness. The bird felt\\nits nature was as empty as a balloon\\'s. The emptiness of its nature was the ground of its existence, but it was also the cause of the bird\\'s suffering. \"Time, if I could find you, certainly I could find myself,\" thought the bird.',\n",
       "    'After several days and nights, the bird came to rest quietly in its nest. It had brought  back a tiny piece of earth from the Dai Lao forest. Deep in thought, it picked up the piece of earth to examine it. The  monk from the Dai Lao forest had said to his friend, \"Time is stilled in Eternity. There Love and Beloved are One. Each blade of grass, each piece of earth, each leaf, is one with that love.\"',\n",
       "    'The bird was still unable to find Time. The small token of earth from the Dai Lao forest revealed nothing. Perhaps the monk had lied to his friend. Time  lies in Love, but where is Love? The bird remembered the splashing water falls  endlessly  tumbling in  the  Northwest Forest. It remembered the days it listened to the sound of the waterfalls from morning to evening. The  bird had imagined itself tumbling like a waterfall.  It  played with the  light shining  on the water, with the waterfall it caressed the pebbles and rocks in the streams. In those moments, the bird felt that it was a waterfall itself, that the sound of endless falling water came from it.',\n",
       "    'One noon, flying across the Dai Lao Forest, the bird did',\n",
       "    'not see the hut. The whole forest had burned; only a pile of ashes remained  where the monk\\'s hut had been. In a panic, the bird flew around searching. The  monk was no longer in the forest. \"Where had he gone? Corpses of animals. Corpses of birds. Had the fire consumed the monk? The  bird was bewildered. Time,  what are you? Why do you bring us here and why will you take us away? The monk said, \"Time is stilled in Eternity.\" If that is so, perhaps Love has returned the monk to Itself.',\n",
       "    'Suddenly the bird felt anxious. It flew swiftly back to the ancient forest. Anguished cries of many birds. Explosions. The  ancient  forest, far away, was burning.  Faster, faster still, the bird flew. The fire licked the sky. The fire spread near  the  great  tree.  Hundreds of  thousands of  birds shrieked in fright.',\n",
       "    \"The fire approached the great tree. The bird fanned the fire with its wings, hoping to put it out, but the fire burned more fiercely. The bird sped to the spring, dipped its wings in the water, and rushed back to shake the water over the forest. The drops sizzled. It was not enough, not enough. The  bird's entire body soaked in water was not enough to extinguish the fire.\",\n",
       "    \"Cries of hundreds of thousands of birds. Screams  of young birds without feathers to fly. The fire began to burn the great tree. Why was there  no rain? Why didn't  the downpour that fell endlessly in the Northwest Forest flow like a waterfall? The bird let forth a piercing cry. The cry was tragic and passionate and was suddenly transformed into the rushing sound of a waterfall. All at once, the bird felt the fullness of its existence. Loneliness and emptiness vanished as an illusion. The image of the monk. The image of the sun behind the mountain peak. The image of rushing water falling endlessly through a thousand lifetimes. The cry of the bird was now the full sound of the waterfall. Without anxiety, the bird plunged into the forest fire like a majestic waterfall.\",\n",
       "    'The  next morning was calm. The  marvelous rays of the sun shone, but there was no symphony, no voices of tens of thousands of birds. Portions of the forest were completely burned. The great tree still stood, but more than half of its branches and leaves were charred. Corpses of large birds, corpses of small birds. The morning forest was silent.',\n",
       "    'The  birds still alive called one another, their voices be wildered. They did not know by what grace the clear sky had suddenly poured forth  rain, extinguishing  the forest fire the afternoon before. They  remembered  seeing the bird shaking water from its two wings. They knew it was the white bird from the great tree. They flew everywhere throughout the forest seeking the corpse of the white bird, but they did not find it.',\n",
       "    'Perhaps  the bird had flown away to live in a different forest. Perhaps  the bird had been killed by the fire. The great  tree, its body covered  with wounds, did not say a word. The birds cocked their heads to the sky and began to build new nests in the wounded  body of the great  tree. Does the great tree miss the child to which sacred mountain air and the life energy  of four  thousand  years had given birth?  Bird, where  have you gone? Listen  to the monk: I believe Time  has returned  the bird to the Love that is the source of all things.'],\n",

Because a number of texts, Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese, are cited throughout the commentary, we use the word <span>sutra</span> as if it were an English word and use the word <span>sutta</span> only when it is part of the proper name of a Pali sutta, such as Satipatthana Sutta or Anapanasati Sutta.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The word <span>satipatthana</span> (Sanskrit: <span>smrityupasthana</span>) is a compound of <span>sati,</span> which means “mindfulness” or “remembering,” and <span>upatthana,</span> which means “place of abiding,” “establishment,” or “application.” In Chinese, the title of the sutra is Nian Chu. <span>Nian</span> is “to be mindful of,” “to put one’s attention to,” or “to remember.” <span>Chu</span> means either “the dwelling place” or “the act of dwelling,” “the act of being present,” “the act of establishing oneself.” Nian Chu therefore may be translated as “the Four Grounds of Mindfulness” or “the Four Establishments of Mindfulness.”</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>For ease of use, the text of the original sutra has been kept with the male pronouns, <span>he</span> and <span>his,</span> throughout, although clearly the message is intended for practitioners of any gender. This was done for ease of reading and to keep as close to the original as possible.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><div id=\"calibre_pb_2\"></div>\n",

Liberation and happiness are linked to each other; if there is liberation, there is happiness, and greater liberation brings greater happiness. If there is liberation, peace and joy exist in the present moment. We don’t need to wait ten or fifteen years to realize them. They’re available as soon as we begin the practice. However modest these elements may be, they form the basis for greater liberation, peace, and joy in the future.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>To practice meditation is to look deeply in order to see into the essence of things. With insight and understanding we can realize liberation, peace, and joy. Our anger, anxiety, and fear are the ropes that bind us to suffering. If we want to be liberated from them, we need to observe their nature, which is ignorance, the lack of clear understanding. When we misunderstand a friend, we may become angry at him, and because of that, we may suffer. But when we look deeply into what has happened, we can end the misunderstanding. When we understand the other person and his situation, our suffering will disappear and peace and joy will arise. The first step is awareness of the object, and the second step is looking deeply at the object to shed light on it. Therefore, mindfulness means awareness and it also means looking deeply.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The Pali word <span>sati</span> (Sanskrit: <span>smrti</span>) means “to stop,” and “to maintain awareness of the object.” The Pali word <span>vipassana</span> (Sanskrit: <span>vipashyana</span>) means “to go deeply into that object to observe it.” While we are fully aware of and observing deeply an object, the boundary between the subject who observes and the object being observed gradually dissolves, and the subject and object become one. This is the essence of meditation. Only when we penetrate an object and become one with it can we understand. It is not enough to stand outside and observe an object. That’s why the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness reminds us to be aware of the body in the body, the feelings in the feelings, the mind in the mind, and the objects of mind in the objects of mind.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The Buddha delivered the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness to an audience of monks and nuns, <span>bhikkhus</span> and <span>bhikkhunis.</span> But that doesn’t mean that the practice of being mindful in the ground of the Four Establishments is limited to monks and nuns. Anyone can practice mindfulness. If monks and nuns can practice mindfulness in walking, standing, lying down, and sitting, then laymen and laywomen also can. Is there anyone who does not walk, stand, lie down, and sit every day? What is most important is to understand the fundamental basis of the practice and then apply it during our everyday lives, even if our lives are different from the way the Buddha and his monks and nuns lived twenty-five centuries ago. When reading the Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness, we have to read with the eyes of a person of today and discover appropriate ways to practice based on the teachings of the sutra.<sup><small id=\"filepos8554\"><span><span><span>1</span></span></span></small></sup></p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. There are four areas of mindfulness, four areas where mindfulness has to penetrate in order for us to be protected, for joy to be nourished, for pain to be transformed, and for insight to be obtained. These are called the Four Establishments of Mindfulness. These four establishments, or foundations, are body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The First Establishment of Mindfulness is mindfulness of the body in the body. This means that when you bring mindfulness into your body, mindfulness becomes the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer. Mindfulness becomes the body, and the body becomes mindfulness. When mother embraces child, mother becomes child, and child becomes mother. In true meditation, the subject and the object of meditation no longer exist as separate entities; that distinction is removed. When you generate the energy of mindfulness and embrace your breathing and your body, that is mindfulness of the body in the body. Mindfulness is not an outside observer, it <span>is</span> the body. The body becomes the object and the subject of mindfulness at the same time.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>It’s like when nuclear scientists say that to understand an elementary particle and really enter into the world of the infinitely small, you have to become a participant and not an observer anymore. In India they use the example of a grain of salt that would like to know how salty the ocean is. How can a grain of salt come to know this? The only way is for it to jump into the ocean, and the understanding will be perfect; the separation between the object of understanding and the subject of understanding is no longer there. In our time, nuclear scientists have begun to see that. That is why they say that in order to really understand the world of the elementary particle, you have to stop being an observer, you have to become a participant.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The Second Establishment of Mindfulness is our feelings. The Third Establishment of Mindfulness is the mind, namely the mental formations. In the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, the Buddha offered us four exercises of mindful breathing to take care of each of these fields of our mindfulness.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>The Fourth Establishment of Mindfulness is the realm of perception. In the sutra it is spoken of as “the objects of mind,” and we can understand this as perception. The Buddha also proposed four exercises on mindful breathing for contemplation of the objects of mind in the objects of mind, so that we can penetrate, embrace, and look deeply into the object of our perception. Doing so gives us the insight that will liberate us from our delusion and our suffering.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>Mountains, rivers, birds, the blue sky, houses, streams, children, animals—everything is the object of your perception. And we have four exercises of mindful breathing in order to help us inquire about the true nature of all these things, including ourselves. Body is also an object of mind, feelings are also objects of our mind, and mental formations become objects of our mind. We can always inquire about the nature of our body, our feelings, or our mind, as well as our perceptions and other things. If we look deeply at the body in the body, it becomes an object of the mind. When we are looking at feelings, then feelings are the object of mind. When we are observing mind, mind becomes the object of our mind. All the establishments of mindfulness are in fact objects of mind.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>A monk once asked me how mind can be an object of mind. I said if we take our two fingers and rub them together, then the body is in touch with the body. The mind is the same. When we look into our body, our body is the object of our mind. When we look into form, form is the object of our mind. When we look into mental formations, mental formations are the object of our mind. So we see that the field of objects of mind is very vast. But the division into four establishments is a convenient tool to help us learn how to practice mindfulness.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>If you would like to study meditation, this Sutra on the Four Establishments of Mindfulness is part of your foundation. This is one of the sutras you keep under your pillow, always with you.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><div id=\"calibre_pb_3\"></div>\n",

He breathes in, aware that he is breathing in. He breathes out, aware that he is breathing out. When he breathes in a long breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing in a long breath.’ When he breathes out a long breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing out a long breath.’ When he breathes in a short breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing in a short breath.’ When he breathes out a short breath, he knows, ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“He uses the following practice: ‘Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body. Breathing out, I am aware of my whole body.’ And then, ‘Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I calm my body.’</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“Just as a skilled turner knows when he makes a long turn, ‘I am making a long turn,’ and knows when he makes a short turn, ‘I am making a short turn,’ so a practitioner, when he breathes in a long breath, knows, ‘I am breathing in a long breath,’ and when he breathes in a short breath knows, ‘I am breathing in a short breath,’ when he breathes out a long breath, knows, ‘I am breathing out a long breath,’ and when he breathes out a short breath knows, ‘I am breathing out a short breath.’</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“He uses the following practice: ‘Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body.

He observes the body from within or from without, or from both within and without. He observes the process of coming-to-be in the body or the process of dissolution in the body or both the process of coming-to-be and the process of dissolution. Or he is mindful of the fact, ‘There is a body here,’ until understanding and full awareness come about. He maintains the observation, free, not caught up in any worldly consideration. That is how to practice observation of the body in the body, O bhikkhus.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“Moreover, when a practitioner walks, he is aware, ‘I am walking.’ When he is standing, he is aware, ‘I am standing.’ When he is sitting, he is aware, ‘I am sitting.’ When he is lying down, he is aware, ‘I am lying down.’ In whatever position his body happens to be, he is aware of the position of his body.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“This is how a practitioner observes the body in the body.

That is how to practice observation of the body in the body, O bhikkhus.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“Moreover, when the practitioner is going forward or backward, he applies full awareness to his going forward or backward. When he looks in front or looks behind, bends down or stands up, he also applies full awareness to what he is doing. He applies full awareness to wearing the sanghati robe or carrying the alms bowl. When he eats or drinks, chews or savors the food, he applies full awareness to all this. When passing excrement or urinating, he applies full awareness to this. When he walks, stands, lies down, sits, sleeps or wakes up, speaks or is silent, he shines his awareness on all this.</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“Further, the practitioner meditates on his very own body from the soles of the feet upwards and then from the hair on top of the head downwards, a body contained inside the skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the body: ‘Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, the nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.’</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“Bhikkhus, imagine a sack which can be opened at both ends, containing a variety of grains: brown rice, wild rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, white rice. When someone with good eyesight opens the bag, he will review it like this: ‘This is brown rice, this is wild rice, these are mung beans, these are kidney beans, these are sesame seeds, this is white rice.’ Just so the practitioner passes in review the whole of his body from the soles of the feet to the hair on the top of the head, a body enclosed in a layer of skin and full of all the impurities which belong to the body: ‘Here is the hair of the head, the hairs on the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, bowels, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.’</p><p style=\"margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em\"> </p><p>“This is how the practitioner remains established in the observation of the body in the body; observation of the body from within or from without, or from both within and without.

       "  'The essence of nonviolence is love. Out of love and the willingness to act selflessly, strategies, \\xa0tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise naturally. Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process. Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance, but a non violent one cannot \\xa0use such blind sources of energy, for they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself. Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.',\n",
       "  'The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and \\'70s arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside, \\xa0and people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people\\'s survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and maintain the strictest \\xa0neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as \"pro-communist \\xa0neutralists.\" Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North \\xa0Vietnamese spoke for the communist \\xa0bloc and the South \\xa0Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist \\xa0bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a \"victory\" by either side.\\xa0 During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children raising \\xa0their \\xa0bare hands against barbed \\xa0wire; students confronting military \\xa0police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and holding bayonets; young women running \\xa0through \\xa0clouds of tear gas with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently; monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.',\n",
       "  'Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for independence from the French, \\xa0and they won the support \\xa0of their countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive resistance and undertake \\xa0positive efforts to over come the war and the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue \\xa0and Danang learned \\xa0that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those cities brought \\xa0their family altars-the most sacred objects in their homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition \\xa0to oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying they used religion for political \\xa0purposes, \\xa0but I do not agree. They \\xa0were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront \\xa0the violence. This was not a political act; it was an act of love.',\n",
       "  'Fasting, the method used most by Mahatma Gandhi to help India in its struggle for independence, \\xa0was also used in Vietnam. Sometimes, \\xa0thousands of people fasted, and other times, a single person fasted. We fasted as prayer to purify our hearts, consolidate our will, and arouse awareness and compassion in others. When Thich Tri Quang fasted for 100 days, those who passed the Duy Tan Clinic were jarred into awareness, and compassion was born in them. As a result, they felt compelled \\xa0to meet, talk, and plan, thereby escalating the struggle. Thich Tri Quang had not planned to fast. He had to fast.',\n",
       "  'We also used literature and the arts as \"weapons\" to challenge the oppression. Works by antiwar writers, composers, poets, and artists, although illegal, were widely circulated. Antiwar songs were sung in streets and classrooms, and antiwar literature became the largest category of books sold in Vietnam, even infiltrating army units. Look Back at Your Homeland, Only Death Allows You to Speak Out, and Lotus in a Sea of Fire sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Our literature was considered \\xa0dangerous \\xa0by both sides. One book of poems, Let Us Pray so the White Dove Will Be with Us, was submitted to the Ministry of Information, and only two of the sixty poems in it were approved. A group of students published it anyway, and within a week, all copies were sold. In Hue, a policeman saw a copy in a bookstore and warned the owner, \"Hide \\xa0this and only bring it out when someone asks for it.\" Sister Cao Ngoc Phuong was arrested \\xa0in Hue for transporting antiwar books, and, before I left the country, I was also arrested and imprisoned for a few days in Bao Loc for \"antiwar\" activities, although I was charged only with the crime of listening \\xa0to Hanoi Radio.\\xa0 Folk poetry was used as means of education.

       "  'roads of Phan \\xa0Dinh \\xa0Phung, \\xa0sat in the \\xa0lotus \\xa0position, poured gasoline on himself, and transformed himself into a torch. His disciple read his last words to the press. Madame Nhu described it as a \"barbecue.\" By burning himself, Thich \\xa0Quang Duc awakened the world to the suffering of the war and the persecution of the Buddhists. When someone stands up to violence in such a courageous way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc\\'s act expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way, including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be \"a torch in the dark night.\"',\n",
       "  'Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She left behind letters to the Presidents\\xa0 of North \\xa0and South Vietnam, imploring \\xa0them to stop the fighting. \\xa0She wrote one letter to me: \"Thay, don\\'t worry too much. We will have peace soon.\" Nhat Chi Mai moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of love.',\n",
       "  \"I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the hearts of the oppressors and call the world's attention \\xa0to the suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination, \\xa0courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots on his body with moxa incense as he takes the 250 vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to helping living beings. If he were to say this while sitting comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered \\xa0while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing \\xa0this kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and mind.\",\n",
       "  \"The \\xa0Vietnamese\\xa0 \\xa0monks, \\xa0nuns, \\xa0and \\xa0laypeople \\xa0who burned themselves were saying with all their strength and determination that they were willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy, \\xa0but to create. \\xa0Suicide \\xa0is an act of self-destruction based on the inability to cope with life's difficulties. In Buddhism, self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions \\xa0of the precepts. Those \\xa0who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance, \\xa0fanaticism, oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that \\xa0lay within the hearts of their fellow men and women.\",\n",
       "  'We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself. Then \\xa0everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence. Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors and students followed suit. There \\xa0were labor strikes at the harbors and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and university students \\xa0boycotted \\xa0classes and examinations. Draftees refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals. The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas, grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these nonviolent efforts.',\n",
       "  'Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement, damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned \\xa0or killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians, workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously wounded-all \\xa0because they refused to take sides in the war. In a memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and neutrality: \"Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways of working for the people of Vietnam.\"',\n",
       "  'Despite \\xa0the \\xa0results-many years of war followed \\xa0by years of oppression and human rights abuse-1 cannot say that our struggle was a failure. The conditions for success in terms of a political victory were not present. But the success of a nonviolent struggle can be measured only in terms of the love and nonviolence attained, not whether a political victory was achieved. In our struggle in Vietnam, we did our best to remain true to our principles. We never lost sight that the essence of our struggle was love itself, and that was a real contribution to humanity.'])"
