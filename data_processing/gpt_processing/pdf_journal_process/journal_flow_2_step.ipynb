Buddhism has been with us for one thousand five hundred years and has shared with the Vietnamese people all the vicissitudes of glory and shame.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Indeed, Vietnamese Buddhism is a national Buddhism. Vietnamese Buddhism is not just a religious belief that, in any time and place, only knows its mission as a religious belief. Wherever it goes in the world, Buddhism immediately adapts to customs, climate, and human character to become a way of life for the masses. In Vietnam, it is the same. Buddhism has harmonized with our national character and has helped our nation build an independent national culture.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"3\">\\n        <p>\\n            Turning back to the glorious pages of our nation\\'s history, we see that the Vietnamese have always aspired to create an independent culture to resist the oppression and threats from the North. In the work of constructing this independent culture, Vietnamese Buddhism has been a significant force. The history of Vietnamese Buddhism during the Đinh, Lê, Lý, and Trần dynasties has proven this. Truly, Vietnamese Buddhism has been a national Buddhism. The character, thought, attitude, and tradition of the Vietnamese people may not suit many other religions but are very compatible with Buddhism. This compatibility is demonstrated in every form.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            A temple worshipping Buddha, a gentle bell sound, a meditation session in rhythm with the wooden fish... to the concepts of human life and the universe, all align with our national character. A writer once said: \"Our soul seems ready to offer itself to Buddha. Anything related to Buddhism can move us.\" Even if a Vietnamese person does not study the teachings, they have ideas, language, and actions imbued with Buddhist Dharma. When encountering an accident, they hastily \"pray to Buddha, pray to Heaven.\" If life is too bitter, they merely sigh: \"Was I clumsy in a previous life, so this life is unfinished?\" They make appointments for the next life. We often hear mothers advising their children: \"Do not waste rice, or you will become a duck pecking at leftovers.\" They have long been imbued with the teachings of karma and reincarnation of Buddhism, or perhaps through daily experiences, a concept of good, evil, and retribution has arisen in their minds that aligns with Buddhist principles.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Some feel sorrow seeing a dead tree or mourn a withered branch... Why do Vietnamese people have such broad and abundant compassion to so readily embrace the compassionate spirit of Buddhism?\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            In the soul of the Vietnamese people, there has truly been the seed of Buddhist spirit. No wonder that Buddhism and the Vietnamese people, for nearly two thousand years, have always accompanied each other like shadow and form in the life of the whole nation. Who could bear to separate them! Being the foundation stone for national culture, naturally, Vietnamese Buddhism must forever be an inseparable element of the comprehensive life.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"4\">\\n        <p>\\n            Today, the glitter of material civilization has blinded many people. Things foreign and novel have been temporarily esteemed, even if they contradict the national spirit. However, the foundation of national culture remains strong, ensuring that even if Vietnamese people are somewhat swayed for a time, they will return to their cherished ancient roots.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Strike the bell of prajna loudly, oh lovers of homeland! The bell of awakening must ring now to call back the wayward elements to their beloved old village. Let us stand beside each other, nurturing the national Buddhism to lead our country to peace and tranquility.\\n        </p>\\n        <subtitle>Vietnamese Buddhism</subtitle>\\n    </page>\\n</section>\\n\\n<translation-notes>\\n    <notes>\\n        Tỳ Ni-Đà-Lưu-Chi is the name of an Indian monk who played a significant role in the spread of Buddhism in Vietnam.\\n    </notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        Original terms and titles: \\n        - \"Tỳ Ni-Đà-Lưu-Chi\" kept as it is a name.\\n        - \"Đinh, Lê, Lý, Trần\" refers to historical Vietnamese dynasties.\\n        - \"bát nhã\" translated as \"prajna\" referring to wisdom in Buddhism.\\n        - \"Phật Giáo\" consistently translated as \"Buddhism\" or \"Vietnamese Buddhism\" as applicable.\\n        - \"nhân quả luân hồi\" translated as \"karma and reincarnation.\"\\n    </translation-notes>\\n</translation-notes>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>The Path of Vietnamese Buddhists</title>\\n    <page page=\"5\">\\n        <p>The righteous path is where a Vietnamese Buddhist devotes oneself wholeheartedly, following that path as a way of life. This path must be thoroughly understood. Nothing is more dangerous than recklessly treading blindly without careful consideration. The Buddha once taught us: \"Being a camel carrying burdens is not suffering. Ignorance of the direction is the first suffering of sentient beings.\" Therefore, having an understanding of the path and the way forward is of utmost importance. This is right view, the correct perception of life. Without right view, we will stray and become lost. Without right view, we will fall into the pit of confusion and failure.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>In a world of instability, living in an era where truth and falsehood are hard to distinguish, a Buddhist must discern what is self and what is genuine. We must find a steadfast position to avoid falling into the traps of desire and the demonic forces.</p>\\n        \\n        <ol>\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Clear discernment of the path or blindly follow a false belief?</b>\\n                <p>We know that Buddhism never nurtures superstition. In life, we encounter countless events that we cannot solve on our own. The successes and failures, the fluctuations, the matters of name, form, wealth, and profit, down to the accidental misfortunes that happen to us or others cause us anxiety and frustration. Life is filled with immense contradictions. The suffering in life leads us to ponder the meaning of existence. If we cling to superstitions, we will become afraid.</p>\\n            </li>\\n        </ol>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"6\">\\n        <p>of ghosts and spirits at banyan trees and riverbanks, seeking fortune tellers and mediums, sacrificing animals, and burning offerings. We will think that our lives are intertwined with gods and ghosts, believing that fortune and misfortune come from these mysterious forces instead of being created by us. No! We must learn the Dharma to understand that the outcomes of our lives are determined not by luck or fate but by our actions, speech, and thoughts.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>If we blindly trust in science, which is considered omnipotent, we will hastily and superficially deny many phenomena that even this omnipotent science cannot explain. We will be in awe of the wonders that science brings to humanity. How can we see that the mechanical civilization born from science finds itself powerless before the problem of life? People think that with science, they can conquer nature. Alas, the weapon to conquer nature now threatens humanity. Just a slight mistake, a clumsy act, or a moment of anger could trigger atomic or hydrogen bombs, leading humanity to destruction. No! We must learn Buddhism to see clearly that if the human mind is not guided by truth, then the science representing that mind will face countless failures. Furthermore, when confronted with human questions about essence, reality, and values, science has never dared to address them, showing that science cannot fully solve the problem of human life.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>If we blindly believe in politics, we will see that outside of the political means we adhere to, there is no other way to transform life and humanity. We will easily heed those who advocate that merely organizing humanity is enough to level the unjust and vile society. We will also easily be swayed by sweet propaganda and be attracted by beautiful terms used to embellish reality. Such terms indeed have a powerful allure! We will believe that only in a good society can people become good, and the first task is to transform society, not to cultivate people. No! We must learn Buddhism to see that only when human actions follow the path of goodness, only when people act out of compassion and altruism, will society be improved. Actually...</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"7\">\\n        <p>who are the ones doing politics to transform society? If they are all those who follow the call of desire and greed, if they are all those who place personal fame and gain above the community, then alas! society will become more fragmented, darker, and more painful. No one can deny that politics is a means. But Buddhism teaches that a person must have some character for these means not to counteract their good intentions. Examining oneself to transform one\\'s karma is a necessary task that cannot be overlooked.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Buddhism teaches right view and does not tolerate superstition. Therefore, we must always learn to clearly recognize the path to avoid being seduced by the dazzling appearances outside.</p>\\n        \\n        <ol start=\"2\">\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Faith in the future or pessimism in the present?</b>\\n                <p>Faced with an imperfect present, living in an era where social dangers become increasingly severe, we may sometimes feel pessimistic. The international situation is tense, our country is divided, and the people suffer; in the face of such tragedies, passionate Vietnamese people rush to find cures through various means. No Vietnamese does not love their country and people, but they may inadvertently cause disaster to their people by using the wrong means. Here, in the realm of ethics, we should not discuss politics. We only need to see that the love for the country and service to the nation must be guided wisely and must be realized by means that do not lead to destructive consequences: the destruction of lives and human dignity. Human life must be considered precious. But the dignity of man, containing a Buddha nature, cannot be trampled upon. We, as Buddhists, fear most the trampling and destruction. We can only apply means that avoid trampling and destruction.</p>\\n            </li>\\n        </ol>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"8\">\\n        <p>Looking around, then looking at ourselves, we ask if humanity is worshipping those means? The acts of trampling and destruction have led to terrible consequences, and humanity is about to awaken. We should not be pessimistic. Let us strive to uphold by action the value of life and the potential for human creation. Millions of Buddhists should express through action, word, and thought the respect for life, the respect for truth. We will unite into a great force, we have a correct path. Vietnamese Buddhism follows the true Dharma, and we will abandon those who advocate using means that necessitate destruction and trampling. We will move forward. Humanity (narrower, the Vietnamese people) will attain peace and tranquility if humanity realizes the need to stand together in the light of compassion and wisdom. We too will find peace if we follow those standards to transform our bad karma into good karma.</p>\\n        \\n        <b>Awakening to one\\'s fundamental nature?</b>\\n        <p>We have rights that we are unaware of, rights that belong to us. What rights? The right to freedom, the right to citizenship, the right to enjoyment, many more. Once we know that we have many rights that we do not enjoy, we will become indignant... we will demand them. To gain support, one only needs to incite a class to awaken to their rights. What motivation is stronger than the motivation of self-interest! Stirring up rights and awakening self-interest is an action that brings about terrible results. Without the elements of wisdom and compassion, the awakening of rights is merely a motivation for mutual destruction... within a human, there is a saint and a beast. If we only know how to awaken the beast, it is very dangerous for humanity.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Therefore, the awakening of rights is not as important as the awakening of one\\'s fundamental nature, or at least it must accompany the awakening of fundamental nature. We must turn inward to observe and contemplate. We must live a spiritual life to realize that our consciousness contains seeds of good and evil and initiate a great internal purification. The more this purification is accomplished, the more we awaken to our fundamental nature. This awakening causes us to wake up and no longer be blinded by external temptations. When that happens, our actions will be in accordance with the true Dharma, and why worry about not being able to help our people and society?</p>\\n        \\n        <ol start=\"4\">\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Belief in human potential or in forces beyond humanity?</b>\\n                <p>Does a person have complete freedom in life? Is a person responsible for their successes and failures? Does a person have the ability to liberate themselves? These are fundamental questions about the value of humanity. If all human successes or failures are not determined by humans, if a person is merely a weak bubble with no ability, with sufficient freedom to progress and liberate themselves, then indeed, humanity\\'s value is not much. Our will and power will diminish if we perceive ourselves as powerless, if we perceive that we have no right to go beyond the will of a supreme and sacred party.</p>\\n            </li>\\n        </ol>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"9\">\\n        <p>A person is born of karma from past and present, having a body and living in a social circumstance. Buddhism teaches that a person must improve their karmic causes to have a better karmic result. That better karmic result is a good person living in a good environment. This goodness is not granted by any sacred party but results from one\\'s transformation of karma.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Some do not believe in supernatural forces but blindly trust in the shaping power of a social organization. They assert that a good society will cultivate good people. These people are as naive as anyone. Admittedly, a person can become good in a good society. But how to achieve that good society? Is it not necessary first to have good people? Furthermore, is it certain that a good society is a forge for good people? Do not conceive of people’s training in a mechanical way. Reality has shown that two people living in the same environment can become different as night and day. A person is a wondrous being, an enigma; how can one boast of understanding it to the root and dare to presume to forge it! Therefore, Buddhists do not believe in anything beyond humanity but rely on the forces of karma creation within a person.</p>\\n        \\n        <ol start=\"5\">\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Living for the true Dharma or living for fame and fortune?</b>\\n                <p>We understand that living according to the true Dharma means creating peace for ourselves and others. Thus, our life has a direction, and all our actions will arise from a legitimate motive: the motive of the true Dharma. Fame and fortune will not control or drive us. We will not serve groups of people who exploit us by using fame and fortune to tempt us. Buddhists should live realistically, not romantically. Often, for a word of praise, for beauty, for a bit of pride, we are willing to sacrifice our lives, even if the sacrifice is meaningless. Sacrifice only has value when made for others, not for ourselves, or for our praise.</p>\\n            </li>\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Aiming for the goal or the means?</b>\\n                <p>When we undertake a task, we often think of the good result that the task will bring. The principle of cause and effect teaches us that good means lead to good ends. But here, the word good must be understood in its broad sense. Because there are means and ends that appear good at first glance but are, in reality, not good at all. This is because we have not placed them correctly in the context of time and space.</p>\\n            </li>\\n        </ol>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"10\">\\n        <p>Giving to the poor is undoubtedly a beautiful means. But if that giving is motivated by a desire for fame, then this means becomes much less beautiful. Sometimes, giving without careful consideration may inadvertently support evil people, immoral and lazy people, and this is certainly no longer a beautiful means. Therefore, one must consider the means in both its content and form and, moreover, think about the end.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>But the end here is not a temporary end, but the lasting consequence of the means. Stealing leads to imprisonment and other damages like loss of honor and being despised, with consequences extending far into the future. But before facing those disasters, the thief may enjoy spending the stolen money. This enjoyment cannot be called the end, the final consequence. One must consider the end in both its content and form, and moreover, look back at the means.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Therefore, saying that a beautiful means leads to a beautiful end is not enough, and saying that the end justifies the means is even more erroneous. We must weigh carefully, especially be aware that means not driven by selfish desires are mostly beautiful means.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Stopping a robber to save hundreds of lives, that action of a past life cannot be called a bad means. But we must remember that we can only perform this if we act from a completely altruistic mind. We will invite suffering and failure if we are deceived by desire. Those who only consider the means superficially may simply lack insight, but those who only aim for shallow consequences and use any bad means to achieve those shallow consequences are blind and cause chaos for the world.</p>\\n        \\n        <author>Da Thao</author>\\n    </page>\\n</section>\\n\\n<notes>\\n    <note>Da Thao is the author of this piece within the \"Journal of Vietnamese Buddhism.\"</note>\\n</notes>\\n\\n<translation-notes>\\n    <note>\"Hướng đi của người Phật tử Việt Nam\" is translated as \"The Path of Vietnamese Buddhists\".</note>\\n    <note>\"Chánh kiến\" is translated as \"right view\".</note>\\n    <note>\"Chánh pháp\" is translated as \"true Dharma\".</note>\\n    <note>\"Dục vọng\" is translated as \"desire\".</note>\\n    <note>\"Nghiệp\" is translated as \"karma\".</note>\\n    <note>Minor corrections were made for improved logical flow, such as adding conjunctions and adjusting sentence structure.</note>\\n</translation-notes>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>The Achievements of Buddhism During the Lý Dynasty</title>\\n    <author>Thạc-Đức</author>\\n    <page page=\"11\">\\n        <p>The Lý Dynasty can be considered the most flourishing period for Vietnamese Buddhism. For over 200 years, spanning eight reigns, Buddhism held a singular position and contributed tremendously to the development of national culture.</p>\\n        <p>If not the sole foundation stone of early cultural establishment, Buddhism during the Lý Dynasty was, at the very least, the largest stone. Spiritually and materially, the influence of Buddhism deeply permeated all sectors of national activity. Today, the spirit of Buddhism is inseparable from the national spirit, and Buddhist culture has become a foundational element in the culture of Vietnam, as the Vietnamese people were initially nurtured by the nourishing and essential virtues of Buddhism.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"12\">\\n        <heading>LITERARY ACHIEVEMENTS</heading>\\n        <p>During the Lý Dynasty, Buddhist monks were highly educated, and thus the monastic community had a significant influence on contemporary culture. Thanks to the \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" and numerous steles created during the Lý period, the poetry and literature of that era have been preserved. Most of the literature and poetry from that time were produced by the monks. Confucian scholars were also imbued with Buddhist thought, so the influence of Buddhism was profound in their writings.</p>\\n        <p>Each temple at that time served as a forum, a place of learning where not only commoners but also nobles and officials studied. Each temple could be considered a university teaching spiritual education, where learning was equal and without discrimination between the rich and the poor, the young and the old. Students endured hardship without complaint; notable officials like Commander Tô Hiến Thành and Minister Ngô Hòa Nghĩa sought to learn from the Zen master at Mount Cao Dã, spending ten years before meeting their teacher. Only those whom the master transmitted the mind seal to were truly satisfied.</p>\\n        <p>Regarding literature in our independent history, the story of the first poem belongs to two monks: Dharma Master Đỗ Thuận and Dharma Master Khuông Việt. In 978, during a diplomatic mission from the Song Dynasty to confer the title of Jingan Governor on Lê Hoàn, Dharma Master Đỗ Thuận was sent by royal decree to receive the envoy. The \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" records that the monk disguised himself as a boatman for the envoy Lý Giác. Seeing two geese swimming, he chanted:</p>\\n        <p><i>Song song ngỗng một đôi<br>\\n        Ngửa cổ ngó ven trời</i></p>\\n        <p>The boatman heard and spontaneously continued:</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"13\">\\n        <p><i>Lông trắng phô dòng biếc<br>\\n        - Sóng xanh chẫm hồng bơi</i></p>\\n        <p>Giác was impressed and, upon meeting the king, showed great respect. When departing back to his country, the king asked Dharma Master Khuông Việt to compose a song in the \"Tổng vương lang quy\" style as a farewell gift. The \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" records this song:</p>\\n        <p><i>Tường quang phong hảo cầm phàm trương<br>\\n        Thần tiên quy để hương.<br>\\n        Thiên lý vạn lý thiệp thương lương.<br>\\n        Cứu thiên quy lộ trưởng.<br>\\n        Nhân tình thảm thiết đối ly trường.<br>\\n        Phan luyện sứ tinh lang.<br>\\n        Nguyện lương thâm ý vị Nam cương.<br>\\n        Phần minh bảo ngọc hoàng.</i></p>\\n        <p>Translation:<br>\\n        <i>Clear sky, favorable wind, the sails unfurl,<br>\\n        Immortals urge the path to paradise.<br>\\n        Vast seas, endless roads,<br>\\n        Yearning for the faraway path.<br>\\n        Overwhelmed before the parting cup,<br>\\n        Remembering the heartfelt bond.<br>\\n        May the heartfelt words for the Southern land<br>\\n        Clearly remain before the royal face.</i><br>\\n        (Translated by Ngô Tất Tố)</p>\\n        <p>After composing the song, the king hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the envoy, raising glasses in farewell. This song is the first friendly diplomatic farewell in Vietnamese history, and it was composed by a monk.</p>\\n        <p>During the Lý Dynasty, monks no longer received envoys, as Confucian officials were competent in handling diplomatic affairs. Yet, Zen masters remained the most literate and knowledgeable in society. The \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" records stories of Zen masters, each accompanied by several poems reflecting their deep understanding of philosophy, rich in subtle and profound meanings. Some poems are more accessible, evoking the serene and tranquil lives of the practitioners.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"14\">\\n        <p>In the sphere of Confucianism, poets and writers were significantly influenced by Buddhism due to daily interactions with the monks. Most of their works have been lost, except for a few preserved in the \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\".</p>\\n        <p>In summary, the literature of the Lý Dynasty was prosperous and heavily influenced by Buddhism. Thanks to Buddhism, with its inscriptions, scriptures, and works, some parts have been preserved. Thus, Buddhism has played a significant role in the development and preservation of our national literature.</p>\\n        <heading>ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENTS</heading>\\n        <p>In fields like architecture, painting, and sculpture, Buddhism was an essential driving force for vigorous development.</p>\\n        <p>The Zen community of the Lý Dynasty left behind four artistic masterpieces, known as the Four Great Treasures of Annam:</p>\\n        <ol>\\n            <li><b>Báo Thiên Tower</b> - A pagoda called Đại Thắng Tư Thiên, built in 1057 at Sùng Khánh Temple, within the domain of Báo Thiên Temple (now the area near Hoàn Kiếm Lake). This tower rose 10 trượng tall, with a total of 12 levels, each brick imprinted with the Long Thụy Thái Bình era name. During the Hồ Dynasty, its top collapsed. In 1427, Lê Lợi built a tower of equal height to survey the enemy\\'s Đông Đô citadel. Later, the Tây Sơn dismantled its bricks for other constructions.</li>\\n            <li><b>Quỳnh Lâm Statue</b> - A bronze statue at Quỳnh Temple. \"Bảo Đuốc-Tuệ\" issue 77 discusses the \"Quỳnh Temple Relics\" by Đồ Nam Tử Nguyễn-Trọng-Thuật, mentioning: \"From the large ancient stele in the temple yard, inscribed with the dimensions and height of the hall housing the statue, Quỳnh Temple\\'s fame is justifiable. The stele stands 8.9 thước tall, intricately carved with dragons, yet weathered by the elements. However, comparing the stele\\'s words with folklore reveals that one could see the hall\\'s roof sheltering the statue from the southern Triều ferry, about 10 dặm from Quỳnh Temple, indicating the statue\\'s size exceeded that of the Chân Vũ statue.\"</li>\\n            <li><b>Phổ Minh Cauldron</b> - A monumental cauldron in Nam Định.</li>\\n            <li><b>Quy Điền Bell</b> - A grand bell cast in 1080 at Diên Hựu Temple, Bắc Ninh. In 1426, besieged by Lê Lợi at the Tụy Động battle, Vương Thông\\'s forces destroyed Quy Điền Bell and Phổ Minh Cauldron to make weapons.</li>\\n        </ol>\\n        <p>During the Lý Dynasty, pagodas and towers were built on a grand scale. Most of the famous landmarks in North Vietnam, existing today, originated from the Lý era. Famous sites in Hanoi like Trấn Vũ Temple (1102), One Pillar Pagoda (1049), Two Sisters Temple (1160), and Voi Phục Temple were established during the Lý period.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"15\">\\n        <p>The Lý kings also constructed many palaces in Thăng Long for ceremonies, viewing harvests, and watching plowing. Although these structures weren\\'t specifically Buddhist, they were heavily influenced by temple construction. Regarding architecture, Professor Hoàng Xuân Hãn translated an excerpt from the \"Sở Trụ Chiếu Trát Tăng Tu\" stele of the Song Dynasty, discussing the One Pillar Pagoda\\'s construction by King Lý Nhân Tông:</p>\\n        <p>\"In the Western Forbidden Garden, Diên Hựu Pagoda (One Pillar Pagoda) was built following old regulations, with new plans by the king. A Linh Chiều Lake was created. On the lake, a stone column was erected. On the column bloomed a thousand-petaled lotus. Atop the lotus was a hall. Inside the hall, a golden Buddha statue was placed. Around the lake were painted corridors. Outside the corridors was Khang Bích Lake encircling all sides. Each side had a bridge leading to the courtyard. In the courtyard, near the temple\\'s front entrance, two towers with ceramic tiles were erected.\"</p>\\n        <p>Although old palaces and temples have vanished, remnants like a few towers, steles, stone pedestals, or intricately carved stones remain, showcasing the exquisite and grand architecture and sculpture of the Lý Dynasty, unmatched by later dynasties.</p>\\n        <heading>POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS</heading>\\n        <p>Among the monastic community, many possessed knowledge beyond religious studies, mastering various disciplines. These monks, well-versed in literature, understood the world’s major trends. The kings respected the monastic community partially out of reverence for the religion but also for political reasons. Our country had just emerged from a long period of colonization to gain independence. The Đinh and early Lê kings were mainly military rulers. Barbaric punishments like the heated bronze columns, boiling oil vats, and tiger cages used by the Đinh Lê to punish traitors showed the primitive nature of a dynasty in its initial cultural development. In the Lý period, politics improved and became more civilized, aided by the knowledge and abilities of the monks.</p>\\n        <p>Dharma Master Ngô Chân Lưu was the first invited to participate in court affairs, assisting Kings Đinh Tiên Hoàng and Lê Đại Hành. He was granted the title \"Tăng Thống,\" or Buddhist Leader, with the honorific Khuông Việt Đại Sư, meaning the great master who supports Vietnam.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"16\">\\n        <p>The \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" records that after Lê Hoàng ascended to the throne, \"all state affairs were entrusted to the master.\" Zen Master Vạn Hạnh also wielded great influence during the early establishment of the Lý Dynasty. From the Lê era, he was renowned as a person of broad vision. When fighting the Song and the Cham, King Lê Đại Hành consulted him. The master foresaw the Lê Dynasty\\'s fall and the rise of the Lý, revealing this to Lý Công Uẩn.</p>\\n        <p>Nguyễn Đổng Chi, in \"Vietnam Ancient Literature History,\" excerpted words from Zen Master Viên Thông, explaining to King Thần Tông about the principles of rise and fall, order, and chaos:</p>\\n        <p>\"The world is like an object; placing it in safety brings peace, while placing it in danger brings peril, depending on the king\\'s conduct. If the virtue of valuing life permeates the people\\'s hearts, they will love him like parents and look up to him like the heavens. That\\'s placing the world in a safe place... Order and chaos lie with the officials; finding the right people brings order, while failing to do so brings disorder. I\\'ve observed past emperors, never has it been that using virtuous people brought ruin, nor using petty people brought prosperity. This doesn’t happen overnight; it develops gradually. Heaven and earth don\\'t abruptly change seasons but gradually shift with spring and autumn. Rulers don\\'t bring prosperity or ruin overnight; people gradually incline toward good or evil. Ancient sage kings understood this and thus emulated heaven\\'s unceasing virtue to cultivate themselves and earth\\'s unceasing virtue to bring peace. Cultivating oneself means being cautious within, trembling as if walking on thin ice. Bringing peace to the people means respecting subordinates, trembling as if riding a horse with a loose rein. Following this path brings prosperity, while deviation brings ruin. Prosperity and ruin emerge gradually.\"</p>\\n        <p>These words show that the Zen masters were truly worthy advisors in political matters. It is a profound political lesson for rulers.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"17\">\\n        <p>a political lesson imbued with the spirit of Buddhism. Thus, the contributions of the monastic community in political affairs were significant.</p>\\n        <heading>SOCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS</heading>\\n        <p>Most temples during the Lý Dynasty had their own lands and granaries: these assets were used to aid the poor and during years of famine. The temple doors were wide open, accommodating the afflicted and those in distress. The \"Thiền Uyển Tập Anh\" records that kings and wealthy patrons often donated wealth for the monks to distribute to the poor or perform charitable works. The Zen community often relied on governmental support to occasionally open ceremonial gatherings, offering relief and alms to the hungry, petitioning for sentence reductions, and pardoning offenders.</p>\\n        <p>The Zen masters were also skilled in medicine, inventing and developing numerous remedies to aid the masses, using them as tools for spreading the Dharma. Ancient texts mention Zen masters adept in medicine, like Nguyễn Minh-Không and Đạo Huệ, among others.</p>\\n        <p>The spirit of Buddhism, with its compassionate and wise teachings and altruistic ideals, profoundly influenced our nation\\'s customs and culture during the Lý Dynasty. The royal customs were much more refined compared to the Đinh and Lê. The brutal punishments and murderous habits of the Đinh and Lê kings showed their lingering savage instincts. The ruthlessness, crudeness, and selfishness still guided the actions of those in power: the murder of King Đinh Tiên Hoàng and his son by Đỗ Thích and the killing of his brother Lê Trung Tông by Ngọa Triều are evidence of this.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"18\">\\n        <p>But the Lý era was markedly different. Although military campaigns against the Cham and the Song involved significant bloodshed, and internal unrest led to capital punishment, we must acknowledge that no era, like the Lý, saw rulers so magnanimous towards the people and adversaries. King Lý Thái Tông pardoned Nùng Trí Cao, and King Lý Thánh Tông spared the life of the Cham king\\'s brother, Chế Củ. While politically advantageous, without innate compassion, such clemency wouldn\\'t have been considered beneficial for their governance.</p>\\n        <p>(Hoàng Xuân Hãn: \"Lý - Thường - Kiệt,\" page 407)</p>\\n        <p>This magnanimity, this compassion, was thanks to the educational influence of Buddhism. The \"Đại Việt Sử Ký\" records the admirable actions of the Lý kings. In the winter of 1055, during a cold spell, King Lý Thánh Tông said to his officials, \"I sit in a warm palace with a brazier and thick clothing, yet I am still cold. How much more so for prisoners suffering in confinement, with insufficient food and clothing? Many die without refuge in this bitter cold. I feel truly compassionate.\" He then ordered blankets and daily meals for the prisoners.</p>\\n        <p>One day, King Thánh Tông pointed to Princess Động Thiên and said to his officials, \"My love for the people is like my love for my own child. Though the people are impeding and ignorant, they must still be punished, but now all punishments should be lessened.\"</p>\\n        <p>This compassion was not a deceitful political tool but the result of a benevolent heart shaped by Buddhism.</p>\\n        <p>After the fierce rulers of the Đinh and Lê Dynasties, we see the emergence of benevolent rulers, less greedy and treacherous assistants. Professor Hoàng Xuân Hãn wrote, \"The Lý Dynasty could be called the most benevolent era in our history. It was due to Buddhism\\'s influence.\" (\"Lý Thường Kiệt,\" page 409)</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"19\">\\n        <heading>CONCLUSION</heading>\\n        <p>Vietnamese culture from the Lý Dynasty had a solid foundation. This foundation was largely established thanks to Vietnamese Buddhism, which continued to be embellished and brightened over time.

       " '<section>\\n    <title>Nguyen Du and the Concept of Karma</title>\\n    <author>By Minh Hanh</author>\\n    <page page=\"21\">\\n        <p>When discussing karma, the author of <i>The Tale of Kieu</i> appears not to have a clear understanding of the concept. The evidence for the theory of karma seems inconsistent; we find in this poet\\'s mind mixed notions of fate, heaven, and the cause-and-effect of karma, which are difficult to distinguish. At the end of the work, Nguyen Du writes:</p>\\n        <p>\"If you want to know why things happen, it\\'s because of heaven:</p>\\n        <p>Heaven has made one a person with a spirit,</p>\\n        <p>Made to endure hardships, must endure hardships,</p>\\n        <p>Given purity, only then can one attain purity.\"</p>\\n        <p>This absolute view of human resentment towards destiny reflects a pre-existing view of the vicissitudes of human suffering. What is man in the face of fate? A floating bubble on water. Everything we have, all the conditions of life, and what will happen in our lives are driven by a supernatural force. This view naturally leads to a negative attitude towards life.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"22\">\\n        <p>But elsewhere, Nguyen Du writes:</p>\\n        <p>\"There is heaven, but there is also us.\"</p>\\n        <p>This means the poet acknowledges that in life, the driving force partly lies in individual action. Furthermore, at times, the poet elevates the value of humanity in an absolute manner:</p>\\n        <p>\"The monk says: Human will can easily overcome Heaven.\"</p>\\n        <p>Overcoming Heaven here means overcoming destiny, changing one\\'s own karma. Here, Nguyen Du elevates humanity to the level of Heaven, perhaps even higher. There is indeed inconsistency in the concept of karma. We see that in different circumstances, Nguyen Du conceives the problem of karma in different ways.</p>\\n        <p>Looking at a dark, painful, and distressing path for Thuy Kieu, the poet feels humanity is too weak before harsh destiny and advises the victim to entrust everything to a high divine being:</p>\\n        <p>\"Knowing oneself cannot escape heaven,</p>\\n        <p>Also entrust one’s face to finish the green days.\"</p>\\n        <p>But even that is only the</p>\\n        <p>essence and more frightening when the victim</p>\\n        <p>gives up hope, is in pain. Sometimes</p>\\n        <p>one no longer places hope</p>\\n        <p>in that high divine being and pours all resentment into fate, with all recklessness, entrusts oneself to a dark, uncertain life:</p>\\n        <p>\"Also close eyes, step forward,</p>\\n        <p>And see where fate will turn.\"</p>\\n        <p>In life, there\\'s truly nothing more passive and negative.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"23\">\\n        <p>However, when the poet sees a bright path, reassured when the victim has passed the dark phase of life, an optimistic idea emerges, dispelling the old darkness and awakening a sense of joy in life, trusting in human capabilities:</p>\\n        <p>\"When successful, heaven also yields to people.</p>\\n        <p>Gently relieve past debts, recompense future ties.\"</p>\\n        <p>People often claim that <i>The Tale of Kieu</i> illuminates the law of cause and effect as advocated by Buddhism. The reality is quite the opposite. Nguyen Du\\'s concept of cause and effect karma is extremely vague and inconsistent, as we see. Nguyen Du\\'s humanistic concept, like that of Kieu, does not reflect the true spirit of Buddhism.</p>\\n        <p>At times, the poet confused karma with destiny, and in the concept of cause and effect, added the idea of heavenly destiny. Combined with a belief in \"talent and destiny at odds,\" the theory of karma in Buddhism, through <i>The Tale of Kieu</i>, has transformed into a folk belief, far removed from the true spirit of Buddhism.</p>\\n        <p>The society in which Nguyen Du lived was not much different from the society in <i>The Tale of Kieu</i>. In a weak, declining society, individuals felt powerless before a major collapse. Social influence weighed heavily on people; in such difficult circumstances, rising up was difficult, and eventually, repeated failures led to pessimism, thinking that people had no right to determine success or failure. Perhaps because of this, people meekly submitted to circumstances, passively before the rapid changes of society, then consoled themselves with a philosophy of goodwill, only hoping for blessings from a divine being to brighten their lives a little.</p>\\n        <p>Nguyen Du was a loyalist of the Le dynasty, served as an official under the Le rule. The Le dynasty was defeated by the Tay Son, and King Le fled to China. When Emperor Gia Long unified the country, he summoned former Le officials to serve, and Nguyen Du could not refuse, so he served under the Nguyen dynasty. However, he never forgot the Le dynasty, and his loyalty caused him pain, viewing his current life as a humiliation. The life and wandering suffering of Thuy Kieu is simply an expression of Nguyen Du\\'s feelings.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"24\">\\n        <p>If Kieu was bound by vows with Kim Trong, then Nguyen Du also vowed allegiance to the Le dynasty. If family misfortune caused Kieu to live a life of wandering suffering, Nguyen Du also lived under the Nguyen dynasty with a desperate loyalty.</p>\\n        <p>The character Tu Hai in the story of Kieu is also a dream that could not be realized in the poet\\'s life. Surely, while serving under the Nguyen dynasty, Nguyen Du still dreamed of the day the Le dynasty would be restored, and the king and his subjects would joyfully reunite. This dream is realized in the final part of the story of Kieu; Nguyen Du allowed Kim Trong and Kieu to reunite after 15 years of hardship:</p>\\n        <p>\"Lovers meet again,</p>\\n        <p>The old flower, old bee, ten parts joined.\"</p>\\n        <p>But whether in resentment, suffering, or dreaming, Nguyen Du always remained in a passive stance. Nguyen Du only knew to lament and dream, without taking action for a revival. Nguyen Du\\'s philosophy is only to defend that passive stance, which is not difficult to understand; that philosophy attributes success and failure to destiny. The whole story of Kieu serves to demonstrate that individuals must fail before sacred destiny. Kieu had tried many times to break free from that invisible thread, but ultimately was defeated. The author of the story of Kieu also fell into that situation, concluding that all things are at the mercy of heaven, and humans are merely a plaything of harsh destiny, not participating in the matter of success or failure.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"25\">\\n        <p>We cannot compel Nguyen Du to cease his lamentations, nor can we compel him to stand up and confront adversity to the end. Because human strength is limited, the societal conditions in which Nguyen Du lived weighed heavily on him, how could an individual\\'s maneuvering overcome the immense power of unfavorable circumstances? What Nguyen Du called destiny is nothing more than social conditions. Most of Thuy Kieu\\'s struggles were due to the societal conditions in which she lived. Nguyen Du\\'s own pains and resentments were similar. Who created the social situation if not the individuals within society? The rise and fall of a society is the result of all individuals\\' efforts within it, and the responsibility for its success or failure does not lie with one person, but with everyone.</p>\\n        <p>Changing the course of events is not the work of a few people, but of a majority. If a cause is not successful, it is not due to any destiny but rather due to a lack of collective effort and majority action. If we have exerted all our efforts but have not succeeded, we should not blame heaven or earth, attributing it to destiny. We must acknowledge that the task surpasses our personal capacity, surpasses our group\\'s capacity. If we remain silent but the room is still noisy, it is not that our silence lacks value, but that others in the same room do not remain silent like us.</p>\\n        <p>All activities of individuals in a community combine to create a form of society, a social regime, either beautiful or ugly. These activities, according to Buddhism, are called karma. Karma has no other meaning than the actions of our behavior (body), speech (speech), and thoughts (mind). The karma of each individual is called individual karma, collectively creating a society is called collective karma. Ultimately, the issue of individuals and society is merely a matter of individual karma and collective karma.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"26\">\\n        <p>Thus, Buddhism does not advocate any reward or punishment from heaven or an emperor, but instead elevates the value of individual and community creation in the theory of individual karma and collective karma. However, this only limits the issue within a certain time and space of life. If Buddhism\\'s doctrine were only this, it would be no different from a socialist ideology. No! The above merely demonstrates a point of the theory of collective karma. Delving into space and time, Buddhism\\'s theory of collective karma profoundly explains the issues of the universe, society, and humans before life.</p>\\n        <p>Thuy Kieu lived in a corrupt society, the society of Bac Hanh, of Ma Giam Sinh, and Tu Ba, and endured the torments and calamities of that society. We must ask if she was responsible for creating that society, only to be affected by it and suffer for fifteen years? Nguyen Du himself declared her innocent:</p>\\n        <p>\"The green hair has committed no crime.\"</p>\\n        <p>Innocent, as it means Thuy Kieu did not contribute any crimes to the current society. But Buddhist teachings assert that in the construction of the present society, Thuy Kieu\\'s individual karma also bears some responsibility. Being born into such a society means she already had individual karma to live in that society. The entire universe and society in which we live are products of karma. That karma is past karma and present karma.</p>\\n        <p>Our actions, speech, and thoughts from past lives have combined to create a universe and society for us, beautiful or ugly depending on the values of those creations. That is speaking of the past. In the present, our creative actions are also karma; present karma continues past karma to create continually. Society and human life are very faithful reflections of karma and can only be changed under the force of karma.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"27\">\\n        <p>Since karma is human action, the issue of social improvement is fundamentally an issue of professional karma. Thus, karma is not a supreme, utterly harsh will of any divine being but is in the hands of humans.</p>\\n        <p>Until now, we have not understood what is meant by \"Retribution.\" When hearing the term retribution, speaking of karma retribution, people often think of payback:</p>\\n        <p>\"The way of heaven pays back severely.\"</p>\\n        <p>In reality, retribution is simply what is constructed by karma. Karma is the cause, retribution is the effect. Thus, the universe and society (external retribution) and our own physical body (internal retribution) are both retributions, consequences of karma, beautiful or ugly depending on whether the karma is beautiful or ugly.</p>\\n        <p>The universe and society created by the collective karma of humans return to influence humans. Nguyen Du has made this influence heaven\\'s destiny. As an individual living in society, one must be aware that this society is a product of collective karma (collective karma).</p>\\n        <p>The maneuverability of an individual often cannot overcome the influence of collective karma, and one should not attribute this to heavenly destiny. If we have strived but have not yielded results, we should recognize that this is due to two main reasons:</p>\\n        <ul>\\n            <li>Individual karma is not good and has not reached full potential.</li>\\n            <li>We need to recognize that our effort to change karma has not reached the final level, and the karma we have created in the present time and past (including previous lives) has led us to an undesirable outcome.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n        <p>— Collective effort is not focused on a constructive direction.</p>\\n        <p>The issue of building an entire society is fundamentally an issue of collective karma. Since society is created by the collective karma of all people, society must also be improved by the collective karma of all people. With individual karma, we have a very limited capacity in the work of creating a new society.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"28\">\\n        <p>Poet Nguyen Du, powerless before an adverse society, could only keep to his role. In his position, we might also only keep to our roles like that. But we should not console ourselves with a negative \"goodwill\" philosophy, but must recognize that even if there is no transfer of collective karma to build a society as desired, at least we must exert our utmost to transform individual karma to create more favorable conditions than the present. Success is determined by two factors: these are the means of personal action and the means of social action. At the very least, if we cannot create conditions for community action means, we must exert our utmost in personal action means. According to Buddhism, construction is based on transforming individual karma and collective karma (personal and social) and is not based on a mystical divine grace.</p>\\n        <p>Nguyen Du, like most people without a fundamental understanding of the teachings, mistakenly equated the theory of karma with the theory of heavenly destiny.</p>\\n    </page>\\n</section>',\n",

Therefore, in the human world, except for the True Dharma, which those who serve strive to maintain in its pure spirit, all other social structures and all other aspects of life are being mobilized for mutual contention, being set in a state of war readiness. Humanity, especially those who speak loudly, what are they doing if not spewing fierce flames at each other, only to truly rain fiery bombs on one another? History has proven this. Thus, indeed, the human world is like a burning house, ablaze and destined to burn fiercely. Fire spreads everywhere, destroying everything! Fire, both metaphorically and literally! The Buddha once said: “The three worlds are unsafe, like a burning house.” Becoming acutely aware of our current predicament, we increasingly feel that these words express the boundless resonance of agony echoing from the depths of each individual.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"32\">\\n        <heading>Yet This Very Situation Contradicts Absolute Faith</heading>\\n        \\n        <p>This faith is the belief in the true value of humanity. Humans are composed of both negative and positive potentials. However, it is more accurate to demonstrate that potential is merely potential; all the negativity in humans is due to their misapplication of these potentials, thus leading to the current state of humanity and the current condition. Therefore, it is precisely the negativity, especially the extreme negativity of humans, that can prove that humans possess true values — all of their potentials — which, if developed by reversing the current misuse as humanity has used its values, humans can become complete: become a perfect being, a Buddha. Hence, the Buddha once said that true values are “pearls wrapped in the tattered garments of the poor.” Our humanity is currently rich in dangers yet lacks peace, solely because we have nearly intentionally forgotten our peace capital by producing dangers! However, the true values of humans remain true values: this is the absolute faith for those who earnestly desire the reasonable progress of humanity.</p>\\n        \\n        <heading>This Faith Requires Extraordinary Effort</heading>\\n        \\n        <p>Because humans contain within themselves a treasure trove of true values, but these values must be developed through reversing the misapplication by humanity, a task currently receiving little attention, let alone being pursued by many with ease. However, it is precisely these true values that make even the most cunning individuals live in a nightmare, yet their lives have moments of self-awareness about the irrationality of their actions: this is the belief of those who serve the True Dharma.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>What is the mission of those who serve the True Dharma if not to sow and nurture human self-awareness, or in other words, to call upon and encourage humanity to apply their true values reasonably? And the less awareness and pursuit there is of this reasonable application, the more extraordinary patience and effort those who serve the True Dharma must possess, fueled by their boundless faith in humanity.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"33\">\\n        <heading>To Serve the Dharma Means to Serve Humanity</heading>\\n        \\n        <p>No matter what, humans still have moments of self-awareness, living with their true values; these are the things that make those who serve the True Dharma, if they have faith in humans to any extent, have equal faith in the True Dharma. The sole mission of the True Dharma is to demonstrate and develop human true values, simultaneously proclaiming and elevating that only true values are the essence of human survival. Humanity cannot be said to survive in a civilized and happy manner amidst deceit, hatred, and war; in summary, if humanity misapplies its true values, it is committing suicide. Therefore, to prevent this suicidal prospect from becoming a reality, the fundamental task is to apply the True Dharma, which means correctly applying human true values. And those who sincerely serve humanity in this way are truly serving the True Dharma.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>People may use the current chaotic state of humanity to claim that the efforts of those serving the True Dharma are fruitless. But why say it is without results? Can one say that a long-term, meticulous endeavor requiring extraordinary patience and effort is an effort without results? But more accurately, a reasonable action compels those sincere with humanity to pursue it according to their aspirations, and the long-term results should not be said to be nonexistent; they are simply distant. This does not sway or deter those serving the True Dharma from their mission. This very belief manifests absolute faith in the Dharma concerning humanity. Those who serve the True Dharma believe as they believe in the Buddha, as they believe in the value of their lives, that if the True Dharma is utterly defeated anywhere, then humanity must perish there, and that place has already meant annihilation for humanity.</p>\\n        \\n        <heading>And Here: An Example of Such Service</heading>\\n        \\n        <p>The Lotus Sutra recounts the story of Never-Disparaging Bodhisattva. Never-Disparaging means both humility and not disparaging true values or human self-awareness. Therefore, Never-Disparaging always said the same phrase:</p>\\n        \\n        <p>“I do not dare to disdain you. You all have the potential to become a Buddha. You will become Buddhas.” Even when scolded or chased away, he never stopped for a hundred lifetimes.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>What do we see in this example of service? First, the notion that everyone will become a Buddha is a statement manifested through all actions, not just words. Secondly, that statement is the goal, the direction of Dharma service, to which those who serve the Dharma must direct all their actions. Lastly, we must realize that only this is the ideal activity of the True Dharma, only this has real value for humanity.</p>\\n        \\n        <p>Precisely because of this ultimate point, anyone who thinks that serving the Dharma means charging into different paths, placing the nature of the era into Dharma service, is thinking with agitation, is influenced by shallow impulses, ultimately, this is the thought of desire. Such a person is truly guilty towards the Dharma and humanity. The comprehensive battle of those serving the Dharma is, first and foremost, aimed at that idea.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <author>Tri Quang</author>\\n</section>\\n<translation-notes>\\n    The original Vietnamese term \"Tam giới bất an, do như hỏa trạch\" is a quote from the Lotus Sutra, translated here as \"The three worlds are unsafe, like a burning house.\"\\n    The term \"Chánh pháp\" is translated as \"True Dharma,\" reflecting the context of serving and upholding the Buddhist teachings.\\n    The story of \"Ngài Thường Bất Khinh\" is rendered as \"Never-Disparaging Bodhisattva,\" a figure from the Lotus Sutra known for his humility and respect for all beings.\\n</translation-notes>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>Awakening from the Dream</title>\\n    <page page=\"35\">\\n        <p>\\n            At times, people pretend to be naive and ask whether this life is real or a dream. This pretense is not without reason. Indeed, this manner of inquiry can be quite charming, which is why many people tend to follow it. Moreover, sometimes people are compelled to pretend this way, as viewing life as a dream can serve as a magical relief for a soul too dissatisfied with reality. Pretending allows one to live more romantically, to overlook harsh realities, and to seek a sense of freedom for aspirations and instincts.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Long ago, Trang Chu dreamt he was a butterfly; upon waking, he did not know if he had dreamt of being a butterfly or if the butterfly was dreaming of being him:\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Trang Chu understands the dream of the butterfly...\\n            Butterfly, man; man, butterfly!\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Indeed. To confuse man and butterfly in such a way is to become a poet and a philosopher. Life is full of contradictions and sorrows, a ludicrous play before our eyes. It is better to believe we are living in a dream to avoid heartbreak! That scene of national ruin and family loss we witness, is it real? If so, how much suffering it brings us. When life does not meet our desires, its reality only adds to our suffering. It is better to see life as a dream and seek life within the dream.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            \"The Little Dream\" by Nguyen Khac Hieu Tan Da is also a manifestation of this mindset. Master Hieu failed his exams at the post-secondary school because \"wisdom is a difficult step.\" He also failed at the Southern School, hoping to obtain a bachelor\\'s degree. Master Hieu was also betrayed in love: the bookseller\\'s daughter in Hang Bo Street brought much suffering to the fair-skinned scholar. Then the dream of Trinh Chu, to use literature to help the nation, to make waves in life so that there would be shadows and clouds...\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"36\">\\n        <p>\\n            could not be fulfilled... And so it ends! If life is like this, why bother with the \"reality\" that brings us pain? *If living does not surpass dreaming, then it is better to dream fully*, as the words of Thuong Chi truly encapsulate the life of Nguyen Khac Hieu. The unfulfilling circumstances of real life have given rise to many small dreams, big dreams... In the marketplace of life, if literature and poetry do not sell, it is because they are suppressed by \"them\"—those who do not have eyes. People have seen \"literature on earth is as cheap as watercress,\" so let the poet sell it in the heavenly market. And how delightful it is to have one\\'s work appreciated by the Jade Emperor and the celestial beings:\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            The celestial beings sat around to listen.\\n            Heaven ordered tea to be brewed for tasting,\\n            Commanded the writer to read his work aloud,\\n            *Yes, I bow and pray to Heaven, I will read\\n            Read all the poetic verses, then prose,\\n            From philosophical essays to playful writings.\\n            In the midst of satisfaction, reading is enjoyable,\\n            Heaven\\'s tea sipped gives a better voice.\\n            Heaven listened attentively and praised.\\n            Even Hang Nga, Chuc Nu, and the North Star, South Star\\n            Applauded loudly after each passage was read:\\n            Long writings, clear voice echoing through the cloud palace.\\n            Heaven listened and found it pleasing.\\n            The heart blooms, the tongue sticks out,\\n            Hang Nga, Chuc Nu frowned their eyebrows.\\n            Song Thanh, Tieu Ngoc stood silently,\\n            Applauded together after each reading.\\n            To dream like this is to live better than to dream. If literature is applauded by Heaven like this, then why beg from those with blind eyes?\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Thus, life sometimes holds less value than a dream. Han Mac Tu longed for dreams but had to endure a life of suffering:\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Years have not become dreams\\n            Singing in excess to ease the sorrow...\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            An ancient Greek philosopher once said:\\n            If your talent, virtue, status, and wealth do not win her over, then do not strive further. Or sleep. Perhaps you will dream she loves you.\\n            How tragic this is!\\n            Such an attitude might be called wise, but it still seems negative!\\n            Surely there are many who wish life were a dream:\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Behold, the world is like a dream,\\n            The mystical machinery opens and closes unpredictably!\\n            How many poets have sung in unison. If indeed life is a dream, then life is a dream by nature, without needing the reminder of poets! Surely people have realized that life may very well not be a dream, which is why they speak so much to make everyone believe that reality is a dream. The harsh realities of life constantly awaken us, and whether we like it or not, we must acknowledge that:\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"37\">\\n        <p>\\n            life is suffering\\n            Life is truly full of suffering. I have not heard anyone say they have happiness. I only encounter on life\\'s path those who lament their fate. On the quest for happiness, no one reaches the final goal, only colliding with one another and falling. Ténon Chrysippe may shout \\'Oh, suffering, you are but a sound\\' but cannot transform suffering away. And the Stoic school recognized the reality of suffering when advising people to grit their teeth and endure...\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            our subjective awareness. Even if we use our subjective awareness to drive it away, it persists. Human beings and their circumstances: these are two aspects of karma. Yes, life is karma. We have a body, a context, joy and sorrow. Why do we have a body, why do we have circumstances, why do we have joy and sorrow? It is not without reason.\\n            There is no need to seek distant answers beyond metaphysical borders, let us calmly examine that we are living in a situation, and we will live in that situation — here, situation is taken in a broad sense, a universe, a world, a human society — until we die. That time is not without meaning. One can either deny both realities: our body and our circumstances. Or one can accept both as reality. But one cannot accept only a subjective self and deny the objective external world, saying\\n            Gemir, pleurer, prier, c\\'est éga- les lâche.\\n            Fais énergiquement la longue et\\n            Lourde tâche\\n            Dans la voie où le sort a voulu\\n            t\\'appeler\\n            Et après, comme moi, souffres et\\n            meurs sans parler. (1)\\n            Since suffering is reality, life is also reality. Do not attempt to avoid life to avoid suffering. How can one avoid life? Life remains, outside of our will.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Even if we consider life a dream, is not our body a part of life? Then we too are a dream, an illusion. How frustrating for human reason!\\n            Thus, seeing life as suffering, considering life a dream and folding our arms to let the world turn is not the attitude of a Buddhist. Buddhism sometimes likens life to a dream only to make us aware of the fleeting nature of existence. Seeing clearly so we can promptly address it, to detach from illegitimate desires causing suffering, not to lament or shun life as if it does not exist.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"38\">\\n        <p>\\n            Suffering is a reality, so life is a reality. Life with all its present suffering is the result of human actions. To avoid suffering, to build a beautiful life, people must see reality, work together along a virtuous path. Beautiful causes yield beautiful effects, where there are causes, there are effects. If we know that life is not an illusion but a reality, we must strive to rebuild it with practical and virtuous means.\\n            Let no one use the excuse of life\\'s transience to claim life is a dream. Has anyone claimed a day is a dream because it passes quickly? Because one day ends but another begins. Life continues endlessly, we should not narrowly think that this transient life is like a shadow or an apparition. It is not a reality, but in which we live is a permanent reality, even if within that reality things are ever-changing. We cannot deny that reality, so we cannot consider life a nightmare and curl up to close our eyes hoping to sink into a more beautiful dream. No, that is just a negative and cowardly attitude of some who do not dare to face reality.\\n        </p>\\n        <author>Tue Uyen</author>\\n        <notes>\\n            (1) Groaning, crying, and praying are equally cowardly.

Visiting the Temples in Hue</title>\\n      <author>Thien Chau</author>\\n      <p>\\n        Hue is home to the most famous scenic spots in Vietnam. Among these, temples comprise a significant portion. Excluding the Buddhist practice halls of nearly two hundred Vietnamese Buddhist Associations and rural temples, there are over a hundred temples within the capital and its vicinity. The most noteworthy among them include Linh Mu, Dieu De, Bao Quoc, Thien Thai, Truc Lam, Tu Hieu, Quoc An, Thanh Duyen, and Tuong Van.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        From their architecture to their worship practices, these temples maintain the ancient and pure Eastern essence in general, and specifically Vietnamese. Anyone interested in understanding the traditional culture and art of Vietnam and Buddhism cannot overlook exploring these temples.\\n      </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n    <subsection>\\n      <title>II. Tu Dam Pagoda</title>\\n      <p>\\n        To understand the harmony between the old and the new in religious architecture and sculpture (not to mention those interested in exploring the form and spirit of the Buddhist revival movement), one must explore Tu Dam Pagoda. Tu Dam Pagoda\\'s architecture and worship practices are different from those of other temples in Hue.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        If fellow practitioners have not been to Hue and have not had the opportunity to visit Tu Dam Pagoda, the following insights are shared to make your pilgrimage and exploration more fruitful and engaging.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        In truth, Tu Dam Pagoda is not the oldest temple, but it is considered important for the unified and revitalized Vietnamese Buddhism movement, which is why it is discussed first. We will subsequently present other temples such as Linh Mu, Quoc An, Bao Quoc, and so on.\\n      </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n  </page>\\n  <page page=\"42\">\\n    <subsection>\\n      <title>III. Location</title>\\n      <p>\\n        For those located in the center of Hue city, reaching Tu Dam Pagoda is convenient and easy. Simply take the Tu Dam bus, stopping at Dong Ba station, with a trip available every 10 minutes, leading directly to the temple gate. If traveling on foot or by bicycle, cross Truong Tien Bridge, proceed on Le Thai To Street, and turn at Nam Giao, stopping at the foot of Nam Giao slope, then turn into the road towards Phan\\'s Church. The pagoda is on a spacious plot to the left. It is situated in Binh An village, Huong Thuy district, Thua Thien province, approximately 2 kilometers south of Hue city. In the past, the temple\\'s land was the entire Long Son hill, but now it spans over one and a half hectares. The temple faces southeast, with Kim Phung mountain as its backdrop, bordered by Nam Giao road to the west, and the Truong Giang and Truong Co hamlets of Phu Xuan village to the east and north.\\n      </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n    <subsection>\\n      <title>IV. Scenery</title>\\n      <p>\\n        Two walls enclose the western and southern sides of the temple, separating it from roads and neighboring villages; the other sides are fenced. The pagoda lacks a traditional three-entrance gate. To enter the temple, one must pass through a simple modern gate and a gravel-covered courtyard measuring around 400 square meters. The courtyard hosts numerous large shade trees, notably a tamarind and a Bodhi tree. The tamarind is old, while the Bodhi tree was newly planted in 1936. Despite being newly planted, its branches and leaves already cover a considerable area. This Bodhi tree is a sapling from the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment, gifted by Venerable Narada. Observing closely, one can see its leaves are thin with long tips, distinct from Vietnamese Bodhi trees; it is currently overshadowing the tamarind. Witnessing the vitality of the Bodhi tree evokes a sense that Buddhism, though originating from India with the aim of cultivating the three virtues of Compassion, Wisdom, and Courage, is well-suited to the Vietnamese people—a nation rich in love, peace, righteousness, knowledge, and sacrifice. Where the Bodhi path, the path of enlightenment, thrives, the bitterness and suffering of beings must vanish.\\n      </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n  </page>\\n  <page page=\"43\">\\n    <subsection>\\n      <title>IV. Scenery (continued)</title>\\n      <p>\\n        Tu Dam Pagoda does not have the curved, low roofs like other temples, which are wide but not deep. Tu Dam stands 10 meters tall, built on a granite foundation a meter and a half high, making it appear even taller. The tightly fitted yin-yang tiles secure the temple roofs. The soaring dragons and Eastern-style ridges are retained on the temple\\'s roof. Under the eaves, Buddhist historical reliefs are carved and embossed on the walls. Meaningful Sino-Vietnamese couplets run along the columns in the front hall with elegance and literary grace.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        Observing these historical engravings and reading the couplets provides a glimpse into the life of the Buddha and His teachings. Among the couplets, the following two clearly convey the essence and principles of Buddhist study:\\n      </p>\\n      <ul>\\n        <li>Buddha governs the ocean of truth, with boundless life, light, and merit.</li>\\n        <li>Study the true meaning, hear, contemplate, and practice accordingly.</li>\\n      </ul>\\n      <p>\\n        This means: The Buddha, as the Enlightened One, understands the truth thoroughly, transcending birth and death, hence possesses boundless life and wisdom that illuminates everywhere with infinite merits. Learning involves studying these true teachings, listening, contemplating, and practicing them.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        The front hall and two bell towers measure 18.5 meters long, leading up seven steps to the front hall. A long wooden sign with large golden Sino-Vietnamese letters reads: \"Thua Thien Provincial Association,\" donated by the Ninh Thuan Association, indicating this is the central pagoda of the Thua Thien Provincial Association. Beyond another beautifully artistic ancient door lies the main shrine. Thanks to its modern, simple architecture, lacking columns but having length, the main shrine is spacious and bright, accommodating about 200 worshippers. However, during major ceremonies, many practitioners must stand in the courtyard as space is insufficient. Further inside is the Buddha altar, elevated, housing the sacred statue of the World-Honored One. The bronze statue, cast around mid-1940, stands 1.3 meters tall on a lotus throne, under a red and gold canopy. Behind it, a halo reflects external light, emitting a soft glow. This statue was modeled by practitioner Nguyen Khoa Toan and cast by Nguyen Huu Tuan. It serves as a model for statues in Lam Vien, Da Nang, Quang Tri, and smaller statues in Thua Thien. This artistic statue also marks a new phase in Buddhist painting and sculpture art.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        The decoration and worship practices at Tu Dam differ from all other temples: it worships a single deity, simple yet solemn.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        In summary, the architecture and worship practices, aside from their aesthetic appeal, also facilitate large ceremonies, allowing the focus of worshippers to remain undistracted by elaborate arrangements.\\n      </p>\\n      <p>\\n        (To be continued)\\n      </p>\\n    </subsection>\\n  </page>\\n  <notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n      <p>The original Vietnamese terms for reference:</p>\\n      <ul>\\n        <li>Dan lam: \"Famous Sites\"</li>\\n        <li>Chua: \"Pagoda\" or \"Temple\"</li>\\n        <li>Dao Huu: \"Fellow Practitioners\"</li>\\n        <li>Kinh do: \"Capital\"</li>\\n        <li>Phong trào Phật giáo phục hưng: \"Buddhist revival movement\"</li>\\n        <li>Chánh điện: \"Main Shrine\"</li>\\n        <li>Thừa Thiên Tỉnh hội: \"Thua Thien Provincial Association\"</li>\\n      </ul>\\n      <p>Translation corrections were made for clarity and logical flow.

The lines of text before him danced wildly; he tried to calm his irritation but couldn\\'t read a single line. His father had just slapped him in front of close friends because he dared to argue when his father insisted he bow before the altar on the ancestral death anniversary.

He pedaled slowly, reflecting on and reviewing the events. He still remembered his father\\'s angry face when he refused to obey him. He found it strange why his father, who was usually gentle, was so strict today. Never before had he been struck, not even lightly, by his father. Yet today, in front of friends, he had received a harsh slap.</p>\\n        <p>Thanh thought and felt angry. He couldn\\'t understand why his father, a man with much Western education, still believed that the souls of the dead could return to visit descendants and enjoy offerings. He couldn\\'t believe that after death, the soul could continue to exist. Death is the end, the conclusion of one\\'s life. Honoring the dead, to him, was merely an expression of regret. A person can think because of the body, due to the brain. When the body and brain are gone, there is no more thought, and thus no more person. Death is the end, focusing on funerals, worship, accumulating virtue, praying, and fasting are all useless. They offer no benefit to life. Suppose people spent their time and effort on the living, on clothes and food, making life more comfortable, wouldn\\'t that be better? He saw that faith was just a reflection of the weakness of sensitive and sorrowful souls, not an essential condition for life.</p>\\n        <p>He nodded, thinking the idea was correct. But he suddenly doubted. Was his father not a sensitive and weak person, yet he still worshiped Buddha, still bowed to Buddha regularly? He believed strongly that people continued to exist after their bodies perished.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"46\">\\n        <p>This thought made Thanh restless; he could no longer be at ease. Thanh cycled toward the garden. Entering the garden, he propped his bicycle against a rock and sank onto a long bench, uncomfortable.</p>\\n        <p>The shouts of children playing ahead drew his attention. A few boys were fiercely dueling with wooden swords. Around them, a group of children cheered loudly. Suddenly, the cheers stopped abruptly. They all ran as if being chased. Only one child remained, pouting with a shirt torn from side to back. A wooden sword had ripped his shirt. Thanh suddenly froze. He recalled an image, a faint, distant image resurfacing in his mind. Wasn\\'t the image of the boy before him the image of himself ten years ago? One day he fought with a classmate, and his shirt was torn. He had pouted and dared not go home.</p>\\n        <p>A dozen years passed like a dream! At twenty-six, he thought himself only a child of eleven or thirteen! He had just been angry with his father, yelled at his mother, as if he would live forever beside those dear ones. People live around fifty or sixty years, then a life ends. His twenty-six years were half a life. Half a life passed like a dream! Twenty-six years! Twenty-six years, what had he done, thought, said? No, no! Twenty-six years had passed, and he had done, thought, said nothing! Life from childhood to twenty-six had passed swiftly, how long would life from now until death be?</p>\\n        <p>Some force made Thanh stand up. His mind worked intensely. In a moment, he imagined his father and mother dying one after another. Was that all there was to their lives? Especially his mother, a woman who had suffered much, who had always cared for him from clothes to food! Oh, his mother was who? Why would that beloved woman die one day? Why would the person he loved most in life, whom he had thought for twenty-six years couldn\\'t die, couldn\\'t disappear, die one day, leave him? Could it be that when his mother died, she would be completely gone? No, no! It couldn\\'t be that someone like her could disappear!</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"47\">\\n        <p>And what about himself? What was he? Why was he born, why did he exist for fifty or sixty years, why would he die? In the vastness of space and the infinity of time, his image appeared and vanished like a shadow on a screen. Could it be? Could he, himself, an individual capable of thinking, feeling pain, and perceiving, disappear completely, vanish like a wisp of white smoke on a blue sky?</p>\\n        <p>If a person is just a body and soul existing for a mere few decades, then truly life is meaningless. It is a deep resentment for reason. He saw that all the effort of study, all the future endeavors were meaningless if death was the end of a life.</p>\\n        <p>A couple strolled leisurely past where he stood. Thanh looked at the woman garishly made up and pondered. He couldn\\'t understand how one could find pleasure peacefully in the dark torment of the soul. Find the meaning of life to build a career, or end the fleeting and brief life?</p>\\n        <p>Suddenly he found his father\\'s attitude to be remarkably experienced and wise; who knows, through life\\'s experiences, he might have found life\\'s meaning? Viewing death as the permanent end of a life was a reckless attitude of those indulging in desires, deceiving reason that nothing remained after death.</p>\\n        <p>Why did saints before dying appear calm, viewing death as a gateway to a new phase in the infinite stream of life?</p>\\n        <p>Suddenly, he found materialism shallow and detestable, and suddenly he felt affection for his father, a man whose faith lit up his firm face. The gentle, profound, and patient image of his mother appeared in his mind, moving him. His mother\\'s life with faith, her precious heart that knew how to love others, made him feel that in that life\\'s direction, one could find happiness.</p>\\n        <p>Though he hadn\\'t firmly concluded that a person couldn\\'t disappear after death, he felt a renewal in his soul. Thanh felt he needed to be closer to his father and mother.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"48\">\\n        <p>No need to seek truth elsewhere. We should search within ourselves and in the life experiences of those we love the most.</p>\\n        <p>*</p>\\n        <p>When he returned, the lights were bright. The guests had all left. Seeing his silhouette, his mother rushed out:</p>\\n        <p>\"Oh dear, where have you been all this time?\"</p>\\n        <p>Thanh put away his bicycle, gently replied to his mother:</p>\\n        <p>\"Mother, I went...\"</p>\\n        <p>He continued with a smile: \"To seek the fundamental principles of life.\"</p>\\n        <p>His mother was bewildered. She didn\\'t understand what her son went to find that he had to miss an important meal of the ancestral day.</p>\\n    </page>\\n</section>\\n<translation-notes>\\n    <p>The original text\\'s title \"TA MÁT\" is translated as \"Ta Mat\" to remain faithful yet comprehensible in English.

       " '<section>\\n    <title>The Five Sciences</title>\\n    <author>Thien-Hoa</author>\\n    <page page=\"49\">\\n        <p>\\n            In the current time, Buddhism must adopt methods that are appropriate for society. This era is an era of steadfast struggle, a time when humanity no longer breathes as easily as in the ancient days. Political, economic, social, and cultural upheavals strongly influence and dominate people, shaking them to their very roots. In such a time, narrow methods of propagating the Dharma may not succeed. We must have methods suitable for the times, and we must possess foundational knowledge for these methods of action. This knowledge, which Buddhism calls the Sciences, roughly divides into five parts, collectively called the Five Sciences.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            What are the Five Sciences? They are five areas of knowledge that a Dharma propagator must possess and understand. These areas of knowledge include Inner Science, Logic, Language, Arts and Crafts, and Medicine.\\n        </p>\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Inner Science</title>\\n            <p>\\n                First, a Dharma propagator must have Inner Science, meaning they must have knowledge of the internal field of Buddhism. To propagate the Dharma, which means to spread the teachings among the masses so that everyone benefits, one must first understand the Buddhist teachings themselves. We must recognize that without understanding the teachings, no one can practice the Dharma correctly. The confusion, superstition, and absurdity of Vietnamese Buddhism arise from the lack of understanding of the internal teachings. Without a clear understanding, one cannot grasp the true principles of Buddhism. Consequently, people engage in erroneous practices: burning votive papers, consulting mediums, making star offerings, relocating graves, and sacrificing animals to spirits and deities.\\n            </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"50\">\\n            <p>\\n                To end such practices, Dharma propagators must thoroughly comprehend the teachings and disseminate the teachings to all levels of believers. It is always crucial to remember that Buddhism advocates understanding before acting, and acting without understanding leads to deviation and error. Leading believers without understanding the internal teachings is perilous. No one can excuse the attitude of \"the blind leading the blind.\"\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Monastic communities must certainly be well-versed in the teachings. Laypeople who engage in Buddhist activities and lead Buddhist study organizations must also understand the teachings. A defect that we urgently need to rectify is ensuring that those who hold positions within Buddhist organizations are knowledgeable about the Dharma.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                We cannot sit idly and remain unconcerned when we see those lacking Buddhist education occupying positions of organization and leadership in a Buddhist association or educational institution like a Buddhist family.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Therefore, it is the duty of Dharma propagators to understand the teachings contained within the Tripitaka: the profound teachings of the three baskets—Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma—with a clear system:\\n            </p>\\n            <ol>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>The Prajnaparamita System</b>: The teaching of emptiness, advocating that all phenomena are not real, to understand the true nature of emptiness.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>The Yogacara System</b>: The teaching of Mind-Only, asserting that all phenomena have no real nature and exist due to the transformations of consciousness.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>The Dharma Nature System</b>: The teaching of Dharma Nature, leading phenomena to return to their true nature, asserting that all phenomena arise from true suchness.\\n                </li>\\n            </ol>\\n            <p>\\n                Each system of teaching includes countless methods for practitioners to follow and achieve enlightenment. A Dharma propagator must understand the systems of teachings and the methods to apply them to society appropriately.\\n            </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"51\">\\n            <p>\\n                In summary, understanding the internal field is of utmost importance.\\n            </p>\\n        </subsection>\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Logic</title>\\n            <p>\\n                Understanding the teachings is not enough. To present the teachings clearly and convincingly, and to establish a strong doctrine, a Dharma propagator must rely on a method of logic; this method is called Logic or Hetuvidya.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                What is Hetuvidya? It is a Buddhist logic that asserts, proves, and establishes doctrines using reason. The great foundational text for Hetuvidya is the \"Great Commentary on Hetuvidya.\" Here, we explore it briefly to understand what Hetuvidya means.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                A complete argument in Hetuvidya must have three parts: Proposition, Reason, and Example, called the Three-part Argument. The Proposition is one\\'s assertion. The Reason is the rationale for establishing that assertion. The Example provides evidence to support the argument (both favorable and unfavorable).\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Example:\\n            </p>\\n            <ol>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Proposition</b>: Mr. Nguyen Van A must die.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Reason</b>: Because Mr. Nguyen Van A was born.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Example</b>: Everything that is born must die, like Confucius, Tran Trong Kim, etc. (favorable example). Everything that is not born does not die, like space (unfavorable example).\\n                </li>\\n            </ol>\\n            <p>\\n                A favorable example is one of the same kind (born and dies). An unfavorable example is of a different kind (not born and does not die).\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Let\\'s consider another example:\\n            </p>\\n            <ol>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Proposition</b>: Student B will be punished.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Reason</b>: Because student B did not memorize the lesson.\\n                </li>\\n                <li>\\n                    <b>Example</b>: Anyone who does not memorize the lesson is punished, like student C, student D (favorable example). Anyone who memorizes the lesson is not punished, like student M, student N.\\n                </li>\\n            </ol>\\n            <p>\\n                We see that the logic of Hetuvidya is somewhat similar to the formal logic (syllogism) of the West, yet it is more thorough and refined because it encompasses both deductive and inductive reasoning.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                The three parts of a Hetuvidya argument must be closely related. The Reason must always relate to the Proposition, and it must thoroughly have the characteristic of a favorable example and absolutely not an unfavorable example. The Example must always be linked to the Proposition and the Reason. Each part—Proposition, Reason, Example—must avoid many errors to stand firmly (See Eastern Logic).\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                The purpose of studying Hetuvidya is to discern truth from falsehood, to persuade non-Buddhists, and to read the treatises on Yogacara philosophy, as the ancient masters employed this method of argumentation when writing those treatises.\\n            </p>\\n        </subsection>\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Language</title>\\n            <p>\\n                This is the study of language, phonetics, and literature. The propagation of the Dharma greatly requires this field. In the past, the patriarchs who wanted to disseminate the teachings in different countries had to understand various languages, possess translation skills, and be capable authors. Many doctrinal texts have been preserved to this day, admired for their bright and eloquent style, thanks to a broad foundation in language.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                In Buddhism, only Zen Buddhism does not emphasize language much. Other sects require language: practitioners need literary knowledge to understand the teachings and practice; Dharma propagators must have literary knowledge to translate, explain, and engage in cultural exchange with Buddhist countries worldwide.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                Currently, Vietnamese Buddhists greatly need language: Buddhism demands a treasury of scriptures in Vietnamese for dissemination. Thus, those with a vested interest in Buddhism must pay attention to studying languages and foreign texts to build a Buddhist education in the national language.\\n            </p>\\n        </subsection>\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Arts and Crafts</title>\\n            <p>\\n                This is the study of technology and craftsmanship. In the work of spreading the Dharma, Buddhist adherents recognize that economic conditions are essential for the development of the Dharma. Economic conditions are necessary to establish learning institutions for monastics and laypeople, to organize relief efforts, and to assist the poor and disabled, exemplifying compassion and loving-kindness. As technology and craftsmanship advance daily, Buddhists must study to have broad means for Dharma activities within the human society.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                If technology and craftsmanship are merely tools for selfish and profit-driven enterprises, they are not worth our concern. Such technological and craftsmanship advancements create suffering for humanity, as they become tools for competition, seizure, and exploitation. The technological advancements of machines and weapons pose a dire threat.\\n            </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"53\">\\n            <p>\\n                Buddhists learn technology and craftsmanship to serve humanity, in accordance with altruism and loving-kindness, desiring true happiness for all beings and avoiding the disasters caused by desires.\\n            </p>\\n        </subsection>\\n        <subsection>\\n            <title>Medicine</title>\\n            <p>\\n                This is the study of medical treatments and methods of healing. The Buddhas are skilled physicians, healing both the mind and the body of sentient beings. The Buddha of Medicine, Medicine Master Lapis Lazuli, is a shining example. In this world, countless people suffer materially and spiritually. While mental healing methods are undoubtedly necessary, physical healing methods are also important. If Buddhists have free time, they should study medicine to engage in a social work consistent with compassion: healing. Doctors and physicians who are Buddhists possess a vital means for Dharma activities. Offering comfort to the sick and supporting them in illness can genuinely represent a portion of Buddhism\\'s active world-saving spirit.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n                We can hope that in the future, Buddhism will have hospitals cared for by Buddhists, and that local temples can have emergency and support organizations for the community in urgent situations.\\n            </p>\\n        </subsection>\\n        <p>\\n            In the present era, society demands broader methods of Dharma propagation. We cannot apply small means but need to expand the scope of Dharma propagation according to Mahayana Buddhism; Buddhists must heed the Buddha\\'s teachings to study the Five Sciences, and each person will become a social benevolent warrior, working to build a thriving future Buddhism and realize the expansive relief aspirations of the Buddha.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <notes>\\n        The Five Sciences are traditionally known as \"Ngũ minh\" in Vietnamese and are considered essential areas of study for Buddhist practitioners to effectively spread the Dharma and serve society.\\n        The Medicine Buddha, known as \"Dược-Sư-Lưu-Ly,\" symbolizes healing and compassion in Buddhism.\\n    </notes>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        \"Ngũ Minh\" is translated as \"Five Sciences,\" which are key areas of knowledge in Buddhist teachings.\\n        \"Nội Minh\" is rendered as \"Inner Science,\" reflecting the study of Buddhist internal doctrines.\\n        \"Nhân Minh\" is translated as \"Logic,\" referring to the Buddhist logic system known as \"Hetuvidya.\"\\n        \"Thanh Minh\" is translated as \"Language,\" covering language, phonetics, and literature.\\n        \"Công Xảo Minh\" is translated as \"Arts and Crafts,\" dealing with technology and craftsmanship.\\n        \"Y Phương Minh\" is translated as \"Medicine,\" focusing on medical knowledge and healing practices.\\n    </translation-notes>\\n</section>',\n",
       " '<section>\\n    <title>Buddhism and Science</title>\\n    <page page=\"54\">\\n        <p>Years ago, with the brothers in the Phat Hoc Duc Duc group, we compiled the book <i>Elementary Buddhism</i>, where we had the opportunity to discuss this issue. Our thought was that today, as science expands its influence on the lives and thoughts of everyone, it would be beneficial to use this as a means to guide new learners towards Buddhism. While many other religions seem to see their strength diminish in the face of scientific progress, Buddhism, on the contrary, can utilize this progress to broaden its means of teaching. As we expressed in <i>Elementary Buddhism</i>, the method of Buddhism resembles the exploratory method of a scholar, and someone who trains their mind with the strict discipline of science can easily approach, understand, and then have faith in Buddhism.</p>\\n        <p>However, comparing Buddhism and science is simply a method to adapt teachings to the times. It does not hold an absolute value outside of time. We should not view science as a timely savior for Buddhism, thinking that without it, Buddhism would collapse.</p>\\n        <p>Recently, we cannot help but be concerned to notice that many followers, in their teachings, have excessively relied on science, unaware that such misuse can be detrimental to the promotion of Buddhism.</p>\\n        <p>Our intention in writing this article is to express to fellow Buddhists where science can connect with Buddhism, and to avoid harmful confusions.</p>\\n        <p>To do so, it seems there is no better way than to sketch the development of thought in science to highlight its essential characteristics.</p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"55\">\\n        <p>The trouble is, we must delve into a few complex specialized issues, especially when trying to explain some new theories. The simpler scientific concepts become, the more complex their expression seems. To make things clear and easy to understand, we have divided this issue into two parts. The first part will address misunderstandings among many followers when discussing Buddhism and science. The second part will explain some characteristics of science and, through that, highlight the connections between Buddhism and science, meaning the points we can use to propagate Buddhism.</p>\\n        <ol>\\n            <li>\\n                <b>Misunderstandings:</b>\\n                <ul>\\n                    <li>Some young friends, eager for faith, have loudly condemned science. They treat Buddhism as a religion like any other, unintentionally placing Buddhism as an opponent to science. They have read many Western religious books that speak of the harms of science. Naturally, the naive minds of twenty-year-olds are easily seduced and captivated by such assertive accusations. Theistic religions always have the hidden intention of denying the value of science to cover up their significant shortcomings. Historically, theistic religions have been a major obstacle to the development of science, a development that represents human evolution. Many of their vague theories have collapsed under scientific scrutiny, so they eventually cling to morality to condemn science as a culprit responsible for many disasters. Emotional indulgence easily aligns with such biased reasoning. Eastern nations are quick to disdain the civilization they call materialistic, mechanical, and barbaric, and simplistic minds readily associate those words with science.</li>\\n                    <li>But science is not machinery, nor is it materialism. These are merely very small subsidiary aspects of science as they are just a part of its application, though that part has become immense, formidable, and currently weighs upon human life. Science, as we will explain in the following section, is a whole system of thought expressing a particular vibration of the human mind in response to phenomena. Airplanes, submarines, or automatic bombs that stimulate our fear of death, the technology of science is changing our entire lives, causing us to forget many other aspects. When considering the application, science today has spread into the realm of philosophy, giving people a gentle and accurate understanding of their position in the universe.</li>\\n                </ul>\\n            </li>\\n        </ol>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"56\">\\n        <p>The narrow theistic view to easily elevate oneself, viewing humans as the center of the universe, is a bizarre concept that has troubled many scholars. Humanity has advanced to a broad philosophical concept thanks to science. Science presents the theory of relativity, where time and space merge into a continuous entity with four dimensions. This concept is not far from the Buddhist view of time and space. Therefore, even though it is only a current aspect, if used wisely, the comparison of Buddhism and science can still benefit the propagation of Buddhism. We should not echo Western religious books: they harshly and biasedly criticize science to salvage faith. If we do the same, we will be laughed at as unconscious individuals, showing that we have only a primary and narrow view of science and its value. They will laugh at us not only for not understanding what science is but also for not seeing the true causes of humanity\\'s current disasters.</p>\\n        <p>The rapid development of scientific technology has disturbed social balance, causing humans not to master machines but instead become servants to them. However, this is not the fault of machines, much less of science. In our inability to use science, in our lack of economic organization, we must find the proper reasons, and optimists still hope for a day when the application of science will become harmonious and beneficial. As Buddhists, understanding the karma of humanity and its strengths and weaknesses, how can we be surprised by such a common situation, and how can we blame science unconsciously? We have no reason to despise and hate science like some impulsive individuals, who, when turning back to the old Eastern studies, immediately disdain the science brought by the West and want to return to the simple, serene life of the past. Even if such a regressive idea is good, it cannot be implemented, and any society that abandons science will be suppressed and decline to destruction.

The vast collection of the three baskets of scripture has become an obstacle for some who wish to study the doctrines and philosophy of Buddhism. Therefore, the task of systematizing and interpreting the teachings is an urgent one. Venerable Thích Trí Quang, whom most Vietnamese Buddhists are familiar with, will gradually present in this section the main thought systems of profound Buddhist studies.\\n        </p>\\n        <subtitle>Preface</subtitle>\\n        <p>\\n            Buddhism has never existed in such a complex situation as it does today. Although Buddhism does not automatically engage in, nor can anyone use it as a force in the cold or hot wars, its true peaceful nature gives it a favorable position in today\\'s world among neutral countries. However, in countries like ours, it inevitably faces confusion and challenges.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"58\">\\n        <p>\\n            It is in such times that self-reflection becomes fundamental and most urgent for Buddhism. Buddhism itself, in reality, is nothing more than a matter of doctrine.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            Examining doctrines merely by labeling one as original and another as Mahayana, and then feeling proud and superior, does not address the issue correctly. The correct approach is to examine the teachings through the needs of humanity, especially the humanity of today. Only this method has the capability to fulfill the aspiration to serve the masses, and clearly, it is this way that maintains the Dharma properly.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            The \"Buddhist Thought System\" we present here will be based on that perspective. In other words, this thought system will be constructed according to this viewpoint. However, the Buddhist Thought System here remains merely a somewhat lengthy study based on a few Mahayana and original scriptures. Therefore, reviewing the standpoint and the content of the issue still earnestly calls for the attention of the venerable seniors.\\n        </p>\\n        <author>Trí Quang</author>\\n        <heading>Vietnamese Buddhism</heading>\\n    </page>\\n    <translation-notes>\\n        <note>The term \"three baskets of scripture\" refers to the Tripitaka, the traditional term for Buddhist scriptures.</note>\\n        <note>The term \"Venerable\" is used to respect the Buddhist title \"Thầy\" for Thích Trí Quang.</note>\\n        <note>The original Vietnamese terms include \"Ba tạng kinh điển\", \"Thầy THÍCH TRÍ-QUANG\", \"nguyên thủy\", and \"đại thừa\".</note>\\n    </translation-notes>\\n</section>',\n",

Despite living in a jeweled palace, surrounded by the loving care of his father and young wife, Prince Siddhartha was deeply moved by the immense suffering of the world and held within his heart an infinite compassion for humanity. After years of intense struggle with himself and his circumstances, the Prince stripped away all the cords and chains of wealth, fame, and love, leaving the palace to immerse himself in the dust of the world, seeking a bright path for life. And he found that path, the Path of Buddhism, the Path of Peace that a third of humanity now reveres.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n            The poetic drama <i>Escape from the Golden Prison</i> will strive to depict the miraculous and poetic life, mingled with the sorrows, of the Prince from his youth until he left the palace to depart.\\n        </p>\\n    </page>\\n    <page page=\"60\">\\n        <title>Characters:</title>\\n        <ol>\\n            <li>Prince Siddhartha</li>\\n            <li>Charioteer Channa (attendant)</li>\\n            <li>Princess Yasodhara (wife of the Prince)</li>\\n            <li>King Suddhodana</li>\\n            <li>Advisor Tishya (courtier)</li>\\n            <li>A Palace Maiden</li>\\n            <li>A Renowned Singer</li>\\n            <li>A Palace Servant</li>\\n            <li>A Drunken Soldier</li>\\n        </ol>\\n        <title>Act One</title>\\n        <p>\\n            (In the Royal Garden, amidst flowers and ornamental trees, the Prince sits on a stone, gazing at the distant scenery, his face contemplative.

Techniques like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning will gain prominence, making AI systems more adaptable and capable of complex tasks with less data.\\n\\n2. **Explainability and Transparency**: With increased AI integration in critical decision-making processes, there will be heightened demand for models that provide clear explanations of their outputs. This aligns with growing regulatory pressures and the need for trustworthiness in AI systems.\\n\\n3. **Ethical AI and Governance**: The focus will intensify on creating frameworks for ethical AI, addressing issues like bias, privacy, and accountability. Companies and governments will work towards establishing clearer policies and standards for AI deployment.\\n\\n4. **Edge AI**: The shift toward edge computing involves deploying AI technologies directly on devices (\"on the edge\") instead of relying solely on centralized cloud systems. This approach reduces latency, improves privacy, and can be more cost-effective, driving broader IoT and real-time analytics applications.\\n\\n5. **Democratization of AI**: Tools and platforms that make AI more accessible to non-experts are advancing, lowering the barriers to entry in AI development and implementation. This democratization will enable more businesses to leverage AI, fueling innovation across industries.\\n\\n6. **Specialized AI Applications**: AI will continue to make inroads into specialized applications such as healthcare (driving diagnostics and personalized medicine), finance (automating trading and fraud detection), and autonomous systems (from vehicles to drones).\\n\\n7. **Hybrid AI Models**: Combining various AI approaches, such as integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks, will gain traction. These hybrid models aim to leverage the strengths of different methodologies, paving the way for more versatile and powerful AI systems.\\n\\n8. **Collaboration between AI and Human Experts**: Rather than replacing human roles, AI systems will increasingly be designed to augment human capabilities, assisting experts in making more informed decisions, and streamlining workflows.\\n\\n9. **Sustainability**: There will be a stronger emphasis on reducing the environmental impact of AI, particularly in relation to energy-intensive training processes. Research into more sustainable AI practices will expand, focusing on efficiency and resource conservation.\\n\\n10. **Increased Focus on Continuous Learning**: AI systems capable of continuous learning will be developed, enabling systems to adapt and evolve as new data and scenarios arise, rather than relying solely on traditional retraining cycles.\\n\\nAs these trends evolve, the field of AI will continue to redefine itself, opening up new possibilities and challenges. Building systems that are not only powerful but also ethical and sustainable will be crucial in shaping the trajectory of AI\\'s immediate future.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1732843026, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7f6be3efb0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=563, prompt_tokens=40, total_tokens=603, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"
