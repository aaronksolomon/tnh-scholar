            The term "Mục Lục" was translated to "Table of Contents." "RẰM THÁNG 9 BÍNH THÂN" was
            interpreted as "Full Moon of the Ninth Month in the Year of the Monkey (Bính Thân)" to
            provide context regarding the traditional lunar calendar. "Thoát Ngục Vàng" was
            translated as "Escaping the Golden Prison," where "Ngục Vàng" metaphorically refers to a
            prison of wealth or materialism. The authors' names were kept in their original form as
            requested.

        <title>The Direction of Culture</title>
        <p>Since ancient times, humanity has been in a struggle. Due to karma from time immemorial,
            humans possess a physical body that exists within a universe, amidst a human society,
            and alongside countless other sentient beings. With life comes the necessity to preserve
            life, either through awareness or instinct.</p>
        <p>Heat, cold, wind, rain, hunger, cold, wild beasts, disasters... these are all challenges
            that humans must overcome to survive. Nature is an adversary, but it is also a friend.
            When weak, nature threatens; when clever, nature serves. Humans, with their hands and
            minds, have harnessed nature, exploited it, and compelled it to provide for the needs of
            life.</p>
        <pagebreak page='4' />
        <p>From the form of an economy based on gathering to one of animal husbandry and
            cultivation, humans have truly advanced. However, from the beginning, the object of
            struggle was not only nature and wild beasts. Humans have eaten humans just as wild
            beasts have eaten humans, so people from ancient times have sought ways to deal with
            their own kind. Groups of five, seven people banded together, using collective strength
            to protect one another. Tribes were formed, and as a result, the struggle against nature
            became more effective.</p>
        <p>The tribal system marked a step forward in humanity's struggle for survival. These human
            societies had their own laws, customs, rituals, entertainments, and survival methods.
            They had culture.</p>
        <p>From the tribal organization, humans gradually moved toward national organization. During
            this period, the mind expanded, and the sense of kinship grew rapidly. The phenomenon of
            cannibalism no longer occurred frequently: humans now directed all mental and physical
            efforts toward exploiting nature.</p>
        <p>But the more exploited, the more nature provided raw materials and food. Simultaneously,
            technology advanced: the quality of extraction and production increased at an unexpected
            rate. The economic issue suddenly became significant. Conflicts arose between nations
            and between classes. Wars erupted fiercely. Science and technology turned to serve war,
            producing bombs, ammunition, and weapons. While struggling with nature, humans turned
            weapons against one another.</p>
        <p>People died, blood spilled, flesh fell. In the past, with limited production means and
            crude tools, humanity did not perish as much as now. All the greed and anger of humans
            have been awakened; humans have used countless insidious and evil schemes to confront
            each other.</p>
        <p>Killing fellow humans? It doesn't matter, as long as it serves the class, satisfies
            personal desires. People kill under the guise of ideals: killing to eradicate disease,
            to create peace. To counter killing, naturally, the opponent also resorts to killing...</p>
        <p>In the past, when a black savage ate a white person, we called it barbaric. Today, a
            nation with weapons that can kill more people is called civilized. In truth, it is an
            unparalleled barbarity and brutality.</p>
        <p>Previously, the direction of culture was to struggle with nature. Now, the direction of
            culture is to struggle with fellow humans.</p>
        <pagebreak page='5' />
        <p>In a vast and fierce arena of struggle, using killing to prevent killing is a futile
            endeavor. The law of cause and effect never errs: sow the wind, reap the storm; plant
            corn, get corn; plant beans, get beans, and cause killing, bear the consequence of
            killing.</p>
        <p>Humans must realize this crucial point and acknowledge that culture has lost its way.
            People need to see that greed and anger have caused chaos in the world and must turn
            inward to initiate a great internal cleansing. We must realize that within ourselves lie
            elements of wisdom and compassion, as well as elements of ignorance and desire.</p>
        <p>Ignorant desires have obscured compassion and wisdom: humans must struggle to eliminate
            them, to nurture wisdom and compassion. With wisdom and compassion, humans can achieve
            happiness, and only then can they unite deeply to create a beautiful and shared life.</p>
        <p>In the past, culture shifted from the struggle with nature to the struggle with fellow
            humans. The direction of the new culture of humanity must be to struggle with personal
            desires.</p>
