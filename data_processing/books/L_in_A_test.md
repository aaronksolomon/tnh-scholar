> [A ]{.calibre2}tone poem, a snatch of gentle, celebratory  music. A
> verse about death, which is really about life. A transmutation of
> death; the emptying of the veins of death, the letting in of light and
> air to those fearful spaces. How does one cope with death, when death
> strikes, repeatedly, senselessly, destroying the young, the noble, the
> brave, the self giving?  Grief  of course,  a period  of silence,
>  space  for mourning. Then afterward, a reassertion, acceptance. And
> finally, if one is lucky, endowed, perceptive, brave with the bravery
> of an artist and poet, he creates something that faces the cruelty,
> the horror, and he brings to that welter of blood, vengeance, cruelty,
> and deceit, a \"sea change.\"

> It is one of the classic and very nearly crushing ironies of the long
> war in Vietnam; that we have been the recipient, time and again, of
> gifts of the spirit, gifts of art, profound understanding, hope
> communicated,  a definition of our selves that exceeds by far our
> expectation of ourselves. We have heard time and again, from the
> \"enemy,\" a stubborn distinction between ourselves as a people, and
> our leadership. Our people have been endowed (by presumption of the
> same \"enemy\") with compassion, political acuity, generosity, and
> goodness of spirit. We were a people saddled for a time with an
> unfortunate and cruel leadership, which persisted in bloodletting
> despite the best instinct of the majority. Thus went the reading of
> our character by our \"enemy.\"

> Such definitions have a mysterious power of creating what they
> signify, in a sense at least analogous to the sacramental. One thinks
> of such \"opinions\" so stubbornly held, so patiently reiterated over
> so long a period of violence, across such unexampled savagery,
> perpetuated  by a whole succession of American leaders-one thinks of
> this, and is simultaneously appalled, exhilarated,  and given hope. Is
> it possible that out of a persecuted, defamed, all but destroyed
> people should arise the Suffering Servant of our own oracles; possible
> that salvation for the heinous, blood-ridden West should once again
> come from the East-and this, not in times of social normalcy, but
> across the curtain of blood that we wove and suspended between that
> people and ourselves, upon which they were stretched and racked, day
> after day, the people to whom Pascal surely had reference, those
> \"crucified until the end of time\"?

> In a universal catastrophe, it is surely presumptuous  to single out
> one element, one tradition, as having \"suffered more\" than others.
> Who can measure such things? They stop the heart in its tracks. At the
> same time, the religious resistance in the U.S. at the time of the
> Vietnam  War could not help but take into special account, with a
> special gratitude, the Vietnamese Buddhist movement. Spiritually
> speaking, we were closest to them. We drew most fully on their
> tradition-such a stubborn, unwavering, gentle, persistent, resilient
> strength! It seems to me far from stretching a point (more likely
> simply making a point) to see in this Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh,
> and his people, a literal living out of the words of Paul the apostle,
> writing  to his community, \"\... fatiguing labors more abundant,
> imprisonments  more frequent, lashings innumerable, many threats of
> death  \... forty  lashes less one \... three  times scourged, once I
> was stoned,  three times I suffered ship wreck; a night and a day I
> was adrift on the high seas; in frequent  journey on foot, in perils
> from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in
> perils from the Gentiles,  in perils in the city, in perils in the
> wilder ness, in perils on the sea, in perils from false brethren,  in
> fatigue and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst,
> in fastings, often in cold and nakedness\.... And apart from these
> things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, my solicitude for all our
> communities!\"

> This monk, this suffering servant, who is also a poet, an activist, a
> teacher, and scholar, suffered a personal loss of the most appalling
> nature. Young Buddhists were studying at the School of Youth for
> Social Service, which Nhat Hanh had founded in Saigon early in the
> \'60s. There the students were imbued with the spirit of nonviolent
> service. On leaving the school, they were to go in groups to help the
> peasants of the South in whatever way possible-building homes, sowing
> or harvesting crops, resettling refugees, simple, concrete  projects
> (we would even say, strikingly evangelical ones). But such a school,
> in such a time, be came a mortal threat to some of those for whom
> weapons were the indispensable means of survival or liberation. A
> period of terrorism  was quickly launched. Students  were killed and
> maimed in a series of bombings. Finally, one night a horrendous crime
> unfolded. Five of the students were seized in their dormitories, led
> to the riverbank nearby and shot. One survived, the others died
> immediately.

> The episode was not widely reported in the world. It was merely
> another bloody stereotyped incident of war, a spurt of gunfire in the
> night, a cry, blood quickly shed, quickly erased.  But not  forgotten
> by a monk who was also the friend of the slain. And so after a time,
> after grief and loss had had their time, came this gift, this
> meditation of Nhat Hanh, peaceful and serious, theologically profound,
> hopeful, light, airy of spirit, a paschal death and victory, a pas
> sage by water from time to timelessness. Written, one may rightfully
> presume,  by one whose soul already  is com pounded  of these
> qualities,  since he conveys them with such skill. Indeed, to him the
> dead are the quick, and violence is by no means the master, by no
> means speaks the last word, or stops the mouth of the victim, or
> indeed finally rules, whatever his boast, his bloodstained  and
> inflated pretentious.

> The ironies implicit in the play are enormous and far of reach. We
> Americans cross the great waters with our techniques of death,
> supersonic instruments  of appetite, great eyes and ears and maws, a
> deranged and decapitated sensory apparatus, to smell out and destroy
> the least lurking evidence of life, health, hope, tradition, faith,
> family, to tear out the very taproot of existence, to plow up and sow
> with salt that culture, thousands of years old, which has unfailingly
> nurtured  a people. \"Let it come down! Let it all come down!\" is the
> manic whine of the Machine.

> And lo, coming  across  those same waters (which  we name
> consciousness, Styx, death, or primordial creation) comes another sort
> of craft, peopled with spirits, listening, bantering, remembering,
> laughing. Their wounds  are healed, their memories lucid. They  recall
> without rancor the method and moment of their death. If there is some
> thing new about them, it is a quality at once elusive, feisty, a way
> of standing within death, fronting it, mocking it gently; perhaps best
> of all, forgiving.

> These  spirits are as they were before death. And this is the genius
> of Thich  Nhat Hanh. His dead have the verisimilitude of the living.
> They are young, they push shadows back instead  of joining them. They
>  push the dark back, they create  space, they speak up. Very different
> indeed from the dimwit ghosts of Virgil\'s underworld;  more like the
> robustness,  the crudity, of Dante\'s  people-those  in hell, chiefly.

> And yet with a difference, which continues to escape my mind. It has
> something to do with a work of authentic Buddhist art, by a monk,
> about his people. A quality of inwardness, almost of austerity; a
> patience that escapes our monitors and timepieces; a serenity,
> caricatured cruelly in the West as stoicism, before death. Something
> of the twice born, the resurrected, something one sees more and more
> rarely in the West; now and again in the faces of the old, in a few
> children, in the cruel ecstasy of street  violence; a light within,
> struck and then out.

> Only  here it is a steady flame. It lights  those  bodies, making
> lamps of them, as they cross the waters in our direction. They  come
> toward us, and their speech is all of forgiveness, of hope, and joy.
> Indeed, the play seemed to me a simple act of forgiveness and
> reconciliation. Are you saying to us, Nhat Hanh,  that the Vietnamese
>  dead will come back to us who murdered  them? will come, not as
> ministers of vengeance, but sacramental presences, angels, spirits of
> new creation?  

> I hope so, with all my heart.

> And I thank you, Nhat Hanh, monk, medium, necromancer, artist. For
> your grief, for your long travail, your exile, for the deaf and dumb
> and uncaring world, for the crucifixion and death of your people.
> Forgive us.

> And because the monk Thomas  Merton  said it to you, and your play
> says it to me, I dare to repeat: Alleluia! We shall see his face!

> At 12:30 a.m. on July  [5, ]{.italic}1967, in the village of Binh
> Phuoc, Gia Dinh Province, a group of strangers abducted five young
> men, brought  them to the bank of the Saigon River, and shot them. All
> five were volunteer  workers in the School of Youth for Social
> Service, a nonviolent organization that sought only to heal the wounds
> of war and reconstruct  the villages. Their names were Tuan, Tho,  Hy,
> Lanh, and Dinh. Tuan was a Buddhist novice.

> Four died immediately. The fifth, Dinh, survived, but his clothes were
> soaked with blood and he lost consciousness. The strangers thought all
> five were dead, so they left.  Silence on the river. There  are many
> stars in the sky, but no moon. A small sampan comes gently to the
> shore. Mai appears. The sampan is large enough to take the four, only
> four, because the fifth, Dinh, is still alive, and must stay be hind.

> The author has said, \"I guarantee that everything in this

> story is true.\" What story is he talking about? Is it the story of
> the five young men shot on the bank of the Saigon River? Everyone
> knows this is true-why does he have to guarantee it? Or is the author
> talking about what happened [after ]{.italic}the killing, about Mai
> with the sampan and the five of them rowing with their bare hands?

> True or not, we will never know. But if the author  has guaranteed
>  it, then let us believe him. Listen  to what he has said: \"I
> remember  when I first picked up my pen to write this play. I saw
> fourteen eyes looking at me, fourteen eyes wide open. I have said that
> I guarantee the story to be true. But what does it mean to be [true?
> ]{.italic}Who  can be my witness?

> \"I have said that it is true because I have lived the life of the
> story. No scientific instrument can verify the existential nature of
> life in this story.

> \"Love enables us to see things that those who are without out love
> cannot see.

> \"Who will be gone and who will stay? Where do we come from and where
> will we go? Are the other shore and this shore one or two? Is there a
> river that separates the two sides, a river that no boat can cross? Is
> such complete separation  possible? Please come over to my boat. I
> will show you that there is a river, but there is no separation.
> Don\'t hesitate: I will row the boat myself. You can join me in rowing
> too, but let us row slowly, and very, very quietly.\"

> [ ]{.italic}

> MAl: Let\'s sit so that the boat stays balanced. I\'ll sit in the bow.
> Tho, can you move over a little, near me. That\'s fine. Now we can
> start to row. Let\'s all use our bare hands. Gen tly, Tho! You\'re
> splashing all over me!

> HY: We\'re going quite fast, aren\'t we, Sister Mai?

> MAI: Yes. We\'re  very light. Brother  Tuan, look at Tho! He\'s waving
> his arms too much and the boat is swaying back and forth. Please scold
> him, will you?

> THO: I\'m not afraid of Tuan. I was a devil alive and I\'m a devil
> dead. Okay, I\'ll keep quiet, but don\'t scold me!

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}Tho, you are a little devil, but a lovable little
> devil. When we were alive, I would knock your head now and then, and
> for good reason. Sister Phuong said you were very bright. I don\'t
> know if that\'s true or not. But you certainly had the hardest skull
> in the world. I hurt my knuckles knocking it.

> THO: Brother Tuan, you hurt your knuckles because you behaved so
> badly! Look at Sister Mai. She never hurt [her ]{.italic}knuckles,
> because she never knocked me on the head. Now that we\'re both dead,
> there is no way to find out whether my head was hard or your hand was
> soft.

> MAI: Please, Tho, be quiet. I can see that you are quite bright. But
> please sit still! It\'s too difficult to row with you fidgeting like
> that. We\'ve got hours to go.

> [HY: ]{.calibre4}Are we really going to see Sister Lien?

> MAl: Yes, Sister Lien and Sister Vui.

> THO: \"What are they doing up there, Sister Mai?

> MAl: Vui is still working for the villagers. And she has also taken up
> drawing. Lien just takes it easy-walking, reading the [Heart Sutra,
> ]{.italic}giving Vui drawing lessons.

> THO: Sister Mai, how can Vui still work for the villagers after being
> killed?

> MAI: Anywhere there are men and women-hell, heaven, wherever there are
> villages- Vui cannot [not ]{.italic}work for the villagers. The last
> time I saw her she was pasting labels on the bottles of the mold they
> use to grow straw mushrooms.

> THO [(teasingly): ]{.italic}She is probably growing the mushrooms to
> sell to the people  in the hamlet.  Vui should  wander about and just
> enjoy herself. She already spent her earthly life working for the
> villagers.

> MAI: Vui has never been concerned  with fun-seeking the way you are!
> She is grown-up, you know.

> THo: I\'m not a little boy. I\'m only two years younger than Vui. I
> worked hard for the villagers too! If I hadn\'t, would I have been
> elected head of the Binh Phuoc work camp?

> MAI: We know you worked hard, but I still think you\'re not as
> grown-up as Vui.

> THo: Please stop teasing me, Sister Mai.

> HY: Why do you keep playing Sister Mai\'s baby brother like that, Tho?
> Head of the Binh Phuoc work camp! Some head! How you went around
>  winning respect is beyond me.

> THO: I don\'t  care for anybody\'s respect. When  we were alive, I
> used to act up a bit now and then to win your re spect,  but  now
>  that  I\'m  dead,  why should  I  bother? Brother Hy, tell me, are
> you sorry, I mean, are you sorry about being dead?

> HY: What a question! Joy and sorrow are the affair of the living. Come
> on now, let\'s row a bit harder, and listen to this:

> [(Hy sings) Listen to me]{.italic}

> [as you would the song of the brook or the song of the bird;]{.italic}

> [as you would look on the green weeping cherry,]{.italic}

> [the pink roses, the yellow chrysanthe\'lllums,  the blue bamboo, the
> white clouds, the bright moon.]{.italic}

> [(Faint sounds of little waves slapping against the sides of the
> boat)]{.italic}

> THO: Wherever Hy goes he brings  music and  poetry along. What was
> that song? It sounds familiar.

> MAl: Do you think you understand that song, Tho?

> THO: Sister Mai, now that we\'re dead, what will we do? Do I have to
> keep working for the villagers like Vui?

> MAl: No, you can do as you please. You can wander around and enjoy
> yourself.

> THO: Great! Then  maybe I\'ll be like Lien. All she does is walk here
> and there. But you said that she also reads the [Heart Sut1·a
> ]{.italic}and gives Vui drawing lessons.

> MAl: That\'s  right, you may do anything you please, just like Lien.

> THO: But why does Vui have to work for the villagers?

> MAl: I didn\'t say she had to. If Vui wants to do that, there is work
> for her to do. The universe of the dead changes according to your
> wishes. [As ]{.italic}I see it, the universe of the living does, too.

> [TUAN ]{.calibre4}[(in a low voice, to himself): ]{.italic}The mind is
> like a painter. It can paint anything it wants.

> THo: There goes Tuan and his Buddhist philosophy! Sister Mai, what [is
> ]{.italic}this world we are in now? Heaven or Hell? [As ]{.italic}far
> as I can see, it\'s not different from the world of the living.

> MAl: It is neither Hell nor Heaven, Tho. And it\'s not as far away
> from the world of the living as people generally believe

> LANH: For that matter, the world of the living is not far from Heaven
> and Hell. Wouldn\'t you agree, Sister Mai? I feel that if I sing now,
> the living will hear me.

> MAl: Well, at last we hear from you, Lanh. You\'ve been so quiet. Yes,
> you are right. The saying \"Yin and Yang are irrevocably separate\" is
> misleading. A lot of the sorrow that plagues the living comes from
> their belief that the two worlds are unbridgeable. Indeed, you can
> sing for the living, as I have many times\... as Hy just did.

> THO: Hy used to be head of the Performing Arts Committee. Tell me, Hy,
> when we were alive, art was a means for rural redevelopment. We used
> poetry, painting, music, and theater to help people. How shall we use
> them now?

> Hy: When we were alive, art was with us. Now, art is still with us.
> Perhaps we are still alive, in some way. While we were living, we were
> already dying. How could we have life without death, or, for that
> matter, death without life?

> THO: You\'re beginning to sound like Brother Tuan.

> TuAN [(clears his throat):  ]{.italic}And just what does that mean?

> THo: Like a philosopher.

> MAl: But, Tho,  you sound like a philosopher, too. We all do. We
> always do when we become aware of something. Now that we are dead, we
> are much more lucid.

> TUAN : This  feels like the Saigon River. Is this still our country,
> our land, our water?

> MAl: Yes, you only died last night, on the bank of this very river,
> eight kilometers back. [As ]{.italic}soon as it happened, I came here
> with this  boat to get you. Now we are going  upstream, toward the
> frontier.

> [(A ]{.italic}[long silence)]{.italic}

> TUAN [(smiling faintly): ]{.italic}It\'s funny, I feel as if we died a
> long time ago. When I saw you coming, I felt as if I were waking up
> from a long, deep sleep. Now, I\'m really quite awake.

> THO: I wasn\'t surprised at all when I saw you, Sister Mai. It seemed
> the most natural thing in the world for you to be there. If you
> hadn\'t come, who would have?

> MAl: It\'s true, I could never be too busy for all of you.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}If you hadn\'t come, we would still be sitting on
> the riverbank, waiting. If we had thought of you and wanted to find
> you, we wouldn\'t have known where to look.

> MAI: If you had thought of me, you would have seen me coming. [As
> ]{.italic}I said a while ago, all things happen here ac cording to our
> wishes.

> [LANH:  ]{.calibre4}It\'s strange. I don\'t feel any sorrow, pain, or
> bitter ness. Sister Mai, I thought we would bear those feelings, even
> after death. The living always tell stories about people who die
> unjustified deaths. They  talk about the revenge of the dead, and they
> become deathly afraid. Now I see that the dead are calmer and more
> lucid than the living. We dead do not think at all about vengeance. We
> just feel compassion for the living, even for those who killed us.

> [THO: ]{.calibre4}If I were alive, I would go to the home of the man
> who killed me to ask him why he dragged  me to the riverbank in the
> dead of the night and shot me. But I don\'t feel any grudge against
> him, none at all.

> [HY:  ]{.calibre4}Perhaps we dead are more forgiving because we no
> longer have to bear the heavy burden of our bodies, and their desires
> and angers. Desire and anger need a home, and now that we no longer
> have our bodies\...

> MAl: But Hy, how can you say that we no longer have our bodies? How
> could I see you if you didn\'t have a body? Our bodies are no longer
> heavy, no longer a burden, that\'s all. See how small and delicate
> this boat is, and yet it carries all five of us with ease.

> THo: You\'re right! We really [are ]{.italic}light. The boat carries
> us and even moves quickly. Tell me, Sister Mai, were you there when
> they shot us?

> MAl:  No.  But I had a strong sense that  something was wrong, so I
> came with the boat to get you. When I arrived, the four of you were
> still sitting  on the riverbank.  Hy\'s clothes were soaking wet, and
> he was shaking a little.

> HY: When  they shot me, I fell into the river. Because my arms were
> tied behind me, I could only use my feet to [try ]{.calibre4}to rise
> to the surface, but they kept shooting  until I sank completely.

> MAl: Oh,Hy\...

> HY: Please don\'t feel sorry for me, Sister Mai. Save it for those
> still alive. I only had to go through a few seconds, a short minute of
> pain, that\'s all. But those close to us, who are still alive, they
> are the ones who suffer. Even those who killed us. They don\'t know
> what they did.

> MAl: Tell me, Hy, how did it happen?

> HY: It was about midnight. Tuan, Lanh, and I were asleep at the Health
>  Aid Post when a group  of armed  men arrived. They tied our arms
> behind us and set the Post on fire. The flames made it look as bright
> as day. Then they took us to the lake near the Tinh Vo Gymnasium and
> told us to wait. A moment later, two more men arrived with Dinh and
> Tho. Their arms were also tied behind their backs. Then they took all
> five of us to the riverbank. We were next to the bamboo grove,
> supposedly waiting for a boat. Again and again they asked if we were
> part of the Youth for Social Service, to be absolutely sure. Then,
> suddenly, they shot us. We four died, but Dinh was only wounded. They
> thought he was dead too, so they left.

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}There were eleven of them. Some were very young,
> sixteen or seventeen. The  oldest must have been under thirty. Some of
> them wore black clothes, some wore uni forms. One had a raincoat  and
> another  a poncho. Some wore military caps and bullet belts. I know
> who they were.

> MAl: I know who they were, too. You don\'t have to say.

> HY: I had the feeling  they were not experienced at the business of
> killing. They  had to kill us, but I could feel their reluctance.

> THo: They obviously had orders from someone. The leader of the group,
> the one who shot me in the head twice, looked as though  he had to
> convince himself to pull the trigger. He just didn\'t have it in him
> to do it easily. When they arrived at the house of the village medical
> chief, they immediately tied us together  so we couldn\'t  run. On the
> way to the river, we had to jump over two ditches about a meter  wide,
> and at the second one, Dinh  fell and they helped him up. I asked if
> they would cut us loose from each other so we could walk more easily,
> and they did. While we were walking, they talked to us in a very
> friendly way.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}The men who abducted the three of us behaved the
> same way. They were very gentle. They let us stop and rest a couple of
> times. I really thought it wouldn\'t be too bad. When  Tho  crawled
> under  barbed wire and cut himself, one man touched  his forehead and
> asked about  it, as a brother would. Another even patted me on the
> shoulder.

> HY: And then they killed us.

> MAl: What a pity! Men are such pitiful creatures.

> HY: Sister Mai, you know I didn\'t say that with any blame. My eyes
> are now open. I see clearly now. I only hope that men discover a
> better way to be.

> MAl: If anyone is tired, you can change your rowing hand. Just change
> seats with the person next to you. Tho,  why don\'t you move over
> there and let Brother Tuan sit here. Good, let\'s go on. But take it
> easy, there\'s no hurry. The stars are so bright. You know, Hy, the
> eyes of the living have a difficult time seeing the whole of life.

> HY: Isn\'t there a way to change that?

> MAl [(speaking very slowly): ]{.italic}Man has progressed some, but so

> LANH: They  asked us if we were part of the School  of Youth for

> MAl: Still, I feel sorry for them. Some will record their love and

> TUAN: Tho! What are you doing now?

> MAl: Oh, no! He has regressed to his childhood. Watch out, dear Tho!
> You are tipping the boat!

> THO: Now that I can become a child or a young adult as I wish, I do
> not long for my childhood any more.

> TUAN: Come  back, Tho, to the Tho of twenty-one. I never met the Tho
> of eight. Please come back at once. THO: All right, here I am. Brother
> Tuan, you are still quite

> bound by appearance. Don\'t you remember, it says in the scriptures,
> \"It is not possible to recognize the Buddha by his physical

> should be able to see me in any form. Why must I be only the Tho of

> TUAN: Okay! But don\'t preach to me from the [Diamond Sutra.
> ]{.italic}Tho, do you really think that I cannot  transform myself
> into a little child just as well as you? I am only afraid that if I
> did, you would be on your knees, begging your old Tuan to come back

> THO [(laughing):  ]{.italic}You\'re the one who was studying to be a
> monk, not I! It is only natural that I would [not ]{.italic}recognize
> you in the form of an eight year old.

> MAI: Oh please, Tho, stop teasing Brother Tuan and sit still. Tuan, do
> you remember the exact moment you were shot?

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}When I saw they had shot Tho,  I recited the name
> of Amitabha  Buddha, and right away I was riddled with bullets. I died
> quickly and felt no pain at all. What  happened to Dinh?

> MAl: He  is still  alive, Tuan.  One  bullet  went  through Dinh\'s
> arm and lung and punctured  his pancreas. I bent down to look at him.
> The strangers had already gone, and Dinh was still conscious. He
> coughed over and over, and each time blood spurted  out.  His shirt

> THO [(thoughtfully):  ]{.italic}When he is well again, he will tell
> our friends what happened. I wonder if he will remember anything to
> tell.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}Maybe it would even be better if he doesn\'t
> remember anything. We died for tolerance and love, not for more hate
> and destruction.

> MAl: I have faith in Brother  Van and our friends. I have

> faith in all our brothers and sisters still living. They have refused
> and will always refuse to choose the road of violence.

> [(A long silence, followed by flarebombs exploding on the

> [bank, illuminating the water)]{.italic}

> Hy: They fire flarebombs all night, don\'t they!

> LANH: If they could see the dead, they would know we are rowing
> leisurely on the river. And they would hear  the sound of the water
> lapping against the side of our boat in the dead of night.

> Hy: They don\'t see us only because they don\'t think of us. If our
> beloved Brother Duc were there on the riverbank, he would see us and
> wave. Sister Mai, why does our coun try go on bleeding? When will this
> fire burn itself  out?

> MAl: Be calm, Brother. Our country will be destroyed and our people

> [(Gun sounds from all sides)]{.italic}

> THO: Some shooting! You know, Sister Mai, my mother can\'t sleep when
> she hears the guns.

> MAl: Is she living by herself? Isn\'t there a child to stay with her?

> THO: She is bringing  up a small niece and they sleep together. But I
> am her only child.

> HY: I heard that your father died a violent death also. Who killed
> him, Tho?

> THO: When I was a child, I knew vaguely that he worked for the
> revolution. But let\'s not talk about this now. Mai, you said a while
> ago that Vui is working for the villagers. I still don\'t understand.

> MAl: You will. Don\'t expect to understand everything in a single
> night. I will show you Vui\'s village. She has many children in her
> school. Her village also has water buffalo, oxen, rivers, and many
> trees-banana, lemon, and manda nn.

> LANH: Then  I too will go on working for the villagers. I remember
>  the lemon trees. But Sister Mai, you still have not told us [your
> ]{.italic}story. What  have you done since you left us?

> HY: Yes, you sacrificed yourself for the cause of peace such a long
> time ago. How many years has it been since then, Sister Mai?

> THO: Years! It\'s only been a few months, hasn\'t it?

> MAl: Everyone has his own notion of time. For me, it isn\'t a matter
> of months or years. It was lifetimes ago, generations ago.

> THO: Tell me, Sister Mai, was the fire very hot?

> MAI: What  a question! I only remember  that I was calm. And my wish
> was fulfilled. Before the moment arrived, I prayed that I would be
> able to sit still in the fire. I sat very still.

> LANH: When we heard the news, we cried like babies. We thought that
> you left us because you didn\'t care about us.

> MAl: Do not say that,  Brother. There is no choice  that does not
> involve suffering.

> LANH: Oh, we were jealous of you. Remember that we were still living.
> We were jealous of your spirit and your act, that is all. I certainly
> understand it better now.

> THo: Then where did you go, Mai?

> MAl [(silent and thoughtful a long while): ]{.italic}I stood on the
> bal cony looking down at my own body enveloped in flames. Yes, I think
> I even smiled, though my eyes were filled with tears. All the people
> standing around were weeping, and I wept with them. But when my father

> can be more painful than seeing  those dear to you suffer because of

> understand. But, as you know, letters  don\'t mean very much.

> [HY: ]{.calibre4}Then what happened, Sister Mai?

> MAl: My father fainted, regained consciousness, and then fainted
> again. Fortunately, an Army captain arrived and wanted to examine and
> confiscate my charred body. My father was so angry that he shook all
> over, and somehow, his anger subdued his pain.

> THo: Three cheers for the captain!

> MAl: Since then I have had all the time in the world, and I have been
> very peaceful. My heart went out to each one of you. Many times I came
> to aid and protect you. What happened tonight is different. It is
> destiny.

> [HY: ]{.calibre4}What have you done since then?

> MAl: I have gone to many places. Up the mountain, down to the sea.
> Don\'t you see? I\'m still wearing white grapefruit blossoms in my
> hair. Even though my eyes have seen our ruined gardens and rice
> fields, my heart has been set free. I know that peace will come. The
> wheel is turning in that direction. I\'ve gone through entire areas
> where the forests have been burned down, charred and black, where the
> bombs have crushed  the earth and bulldozed  the fields, making
> craters everywhere. And I\'ve seen crowds of refugees carrying their
> meager possessions on their backs-babies, cooking pots, a few
> clothes-their steps undecided, their eyes bewildered.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}Can the dead do anything to help the living,
> Sister? MAl [(laughs): ]{.italic}I died a long time ago, but I know I

> THO: Present in the world of the living? How can you be dead and, at
> the same time, present in the world of the living?

> MAI: It is simple. I think Brother Tuan will explain it to you.

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}Go ahead, Sister Mai, you explain.

> MAl: If you set fire to a piece of charcoal, it burns red and becomes
> heat. When the fire dies, the charcoal is reduced to ash. Heat is the
> afterlife of the charcoal. From then on, the heat begins an
> uninterrupted  process of influences, either in terms of energy or
> physical properties. And that process of transformation, like a chain
> reaction, takes place either directly or indirectly in relation to
> other processes of transformation.

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}We call it \"correlated reactions.\"

> MAI: Yes, \"correlated  reactions.\" Nothing  can be lost; yet at the
> same time, nothing that remains static can keep its nature intact.

> HY: It\'s the same as when Tho  became the eight year old he once was.
> Even though  we did not recognize him, he was exactly what he was.

> MAl: Death is change, a sudden evolution, that\'s all. If Tho had died
> when he was eight,  there would not have been any Tho of twenty-one to
> die just a while ago and to be sit ting here now. Actually, though,
>  the eight year old Tho had to die, to give way to the twenty-one year
> old Tho. But the death of the eight-year-old Tho was not sudden. It
> was a progressive change, a process of growing.

> THO: One could also say it was a second-by-second evolution, while our
> own deaths tonight are an evolution of an entire period, an entire
> cycle.

> MAl: That is more  to the  point  than  my explanation, Brother Tuan.
> That is it, Hy. In order to grow, Tho had to receive support from many
> other forms of existence-air for his lungs, food for his body,
> education  for his mind, love for his heart. In Tho,  there are
> innumerable physical and mental beings-his father and mother, myself,
> and that girl with ruddy cheeks who will cry this morning over his
> departure. She should  be sleeping peacefully now in the world of the
> living.

> THO: I see, Sister Mai! You are saying that I am present in her now,
> too, and in all who love me in the world of the living. That is why I
> am still there, and still able to provoke this chain reaction.

> MAl: That\'s right.  But you are not only present  within them, you
> are present outside them as well. All you have said and done has
> already begun its journey. You are pre sent everywhere.

> LANH: Then  what we see in front of us now is not all of Tho?

> MAl: How can it be when already the Tho of twenty-one is no longer the
> Tho of eight? The Tho in front of us is only the Tho of the narrow
> world of our perceptions. He is merely our perception of Tho.

> LANH [(raising one finger): ]{.italic}Sister Mai, first let me say
> something, then you tell me whether I am wrong or right. We are rowing
> up the Saigon River and telling ourselves that we are going to pay a
> visit to Lien and Vui. Actually, we are only going to see the Lien and
> Vui in the world of our own perceptions because their real existence
> is far greater. We only need to look back to see them everywhere.

> MAl: You are right. What we are doing is searching for the Lien and
> Vui of our feelings and habits. That  is why we have to struggle
> upstream to reach the frontier. In truth, they are even more  present
>  in the world of the  living. Their  presence there is clearer and
> more substantial than in this world.

> THO: Still, I would like to visit the village where Vui is working to
> see if she is doing better than last year. And I would like to see the
> lemon trees of my homeland again.

> MAl: But no one says you cannot. You will see Vui. You can even become
> a work camp head here, you know.

> THO: And Lien, where is she now?

> MAl: She lives with Vui, leisurely and peacefully, smiling almost all
> the time. They are practically inseparable. The last time I saw her,
> she had the whole collection of the [Maha  Prajñaparamita  Sutra
>  ]{.italic}in her hand. You know, she is reading the entire
> collection.

> TUAN: If I read the [Prajña Sutra  ]{.italic}now, I think I would
> understand it much more easily. There is such peace and calm within my
> heart.

> MAl: When we see Lien, we have to ask her to explain the Prajña Sutra
> to us.

> TUAN: When I was alive, not a day passed when I did not recite the
> [Heart Sutra. ]{.italic}I thought I understood it. But it was only
> when the man with the poncho pointed a gun at my head that I really
> saw what the [Heart Sutra ]{.italic}was all about.

> LANH: Tell us, Brother Tuan, what did you see?

> TUAN: It\'s hard to say, Lanh. It\'s not something to be un derstood
> but to be [seen. ]{.italic}We can easily explain what we un derstand,
> but not what we see or perceive. It came all of a sudden, like
> lightning.

> LANH [(begging): ]{.italic}But try, Brother Tuan, what did you see?
> TUAN: Well, when that man with the poncho brought his

> gun up to my head, I realized immediately, without being aware of it
> consciously, that he was not going to shoot [me. ]{.italic}He was
> going to shoot something  else, but not me. How could  he shoot  me
> without knowing  who I was? Since then, I have been wondering how
> someone can blow the brains out of another without knowing him.

> THo: You are funny, Brother Tuan! He asked us over and over again to
> make sure that we really were the Youth for Social Service, before he
> killed us. He shot you because he [knew ]{.italic}who you were. You
> were a member of the Youth for Social Service. They  wanted to kill
> the Youth for Social Service. Therefore  they shot you.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}Why are you smiling, Sister Mai?

> MAl: Tho is speaking in terms of logic, and the [Heart Sutra
> ]{.italic}is exactly the tool we need to shatter  that kind of
> reasoning.

> [TuAN: ]{.calibre4}I agree with you, Sister Mai. \"Youth for Social
> Service\" is just a label that they pasted on the objects of their
> hatred or fear, an object that exists only in their perception. It has
> nothing to do with us as persons. They shot only at the object of
> their fear and hatred,  but because they had pasted the label of this
> object on us, they ended up shooting us, and we died by mistake. They
> killed us because they truly did not know who we were.

> HY: Brother Tuan, are you speaking about wrong perceptions? Hatred
>  and fear blind us. We no longer see each other. We see only the faces
> of monsters, and that gives us the courage to destroy each other.

> MAl: The  war that is raging in our homeland is caused by exactly this
> blindness. Those who are shooting at this very moment  do not know who
> they are fighting. All are victims. And some are ready to profit from
> the mutual destruction.

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}That is certainly true of those who killed us. In a
> fleeting moment, I think they saw that we were just human beings, not
> monsters. But, when the moment arrived, they

> had to shoot, to obey orders. It must be the cruel, irrevocable order
> imposed on man\'s destiny.

> THo: Oh, Lanh, you talk as if there were such a thing as an abstract
>  order. That order came from their superiors,  who else?

> MAl: You do not  understand, Tho. The ones who killed you were only
> obeying  the orders  of their superiors. And those superiors  were
> also victims. Yet, those who shot you did show their human qualities.
> They hesitated,  not wanting to kill you, fighting against
>  themselves. They had to carry out their orders  because they were
> crushed  between the hammer and the anvil, the orders  and their
>  families, their  jobs, even their lives. Their consciences  and
> perceptions had been greatly obscured.

> HY: One man even exclaimed, \"God, you are all so young!\" It was not
>  just an expression of pity for us, but also a pro test against his
> own fate.

> MAl: Men kill because, on the one hand, they do not know their  real
> enemy, and on the other  hand,  they are pushed into a position  where
> they must kill. Let me tell you what happened  to our Brother  Duc
> last year. He was waiting for a civilian plane at a small isolated
> airport  in the highlands, along with a young American army officer
> who was waiting for a caribou plane to fly him on a search-and-destroy
> operation. There was no one else besides  the two of them. The young
> American struck up a conversation  with Brother Duc, who immediately
> saw that the man knew nothing about Vietnamese history or culture or
> the  truth of the conflict in which he was playing a part. He knew
> only one thing: the Vietcong were his enemy. His duty, as he put it,
> was to destroy the Vietcong in order  to save the Vietnamese and the
> free world. Brother  Duc felt so sad. He asked the GI, \"Are you
> afraid of Vietcong?\" With  that question the soldier leaped to his
> feet. Duc saw the alarm and suspi cion in his eyes, fear that Duc
> himself might be a VC. The GI had been told again and again that the
> VC were very cunning, and wherever he went, he imagined that the VC
> were present. So he asked rapidly, putting his hands on his gun, \"Are
> you a VC?\" Brother Duc thought  the question was funny, but he dared
> not smile. He knew that if he said, in a joking spirit, \"Yes,\" the
> soldier would shoot him. So he answered, \"No,\" and explained that he
> was only a professor of religion waiting to catch a plane back to
> Saigon. Do you know what our Brother Duc said after he had told us
> about this incident?  He said that if he had been killed then, it
> would not have been because the American soldier wanted to kill him.
> The  soldier only wanted to kill Vietcong. He could hate the VC only
> because he did not really know what the VC were. He imagined that they
> were wild, cruel monsters that had to be hunted down. In his country
> the people are fed so much of this that they keep letting their
> government send men over here to kill and be killed. So, men kill
> unjustly and in turn are killed unjustly, and it is their own
> countrymen  who kill them. They  are the ones responsible for the
> massacre of our people, but they think they have nothing to do with it
> because it is not they who hold the guns and pull the triggers. Who is
> really killing us? It is fear, hatred, and prejudice.

> LANH: The world of the living is shrouded in fog. All I feel now is
> compassion for the destiny of mankind. It is like walking in a
> moonless, starless night.

> MAl: Excuse me, but may I change the subject? You know, one of the
> reasons I am taking you to see Sister Lien is that I want you to see
> her paintings. I believe that she has really achieved something. In
> her earthly life she loved art very much, but now she has realized it.
> I am sure she draws inspiration from the [Heart Sutra.]{.italic}

> HY: Vui, too, used to love art when she was alive. I suppose they are
> in accord now. I love painting  myself. Do you think I will understand
> Sister  Lien\'s work? Inspiration drawn from the [Heart Sutra,
> ]{.italic}that\'s awesome!

> MAl: What wouldn\'t you be able to understand, Hy? Just a while ago we
> discussed the [Prajñaparamita ]{.italic}itself! We each paint our own
> lives.  If your work is broad and free your life will be broad and
> free, also. That  is all. We create our own worlds with our visions,
> conceptions, and thoughts. We might create a constricted world of
> suffering and sorrow, or one that is immense  and free, a truly
>  beautiful place. The essential ingredient is a spirit of openness,
> tolerance, and freedom.

> [HY: ]{.calibre4}Now I understand what Brother Tuan meant when he
> said, \"The mind is like a painter.\"

> MAl [(laughs): ]{.italic}Yes. Why don\'t you all begin here and now to
> paint your own lives. Every artist is capable, through  his art, of
> reaching the supreme objective of life itself.

> Tho: Then my picture, Sister Mai, will probably look like that of Vui.
> My world must contain a lemon tree! I once threatened Brother Duc
>  that  if the Pure  Land  has no lemon trees I will refuse to enter!
> But that\'s not all. My world will also have coconut trees, moats
> where the water is clear in the morning,  thatch-roofed schools where
> at noontime  the children\'s singing reaches my ears: \"Lam Son
> Mountains! Lam Son Mountains! Banners flapping in the wind!\"

> [LANH: ]{.calibre4}Tho, do be quiet!I didn\'t realize that the dead
> could be homesick! When  little Thanh of Binh Phuoc Hamlet hears that
> his teacher has been killed, he will cry until he has no tears left.
> Yes, our Pure Land must contain those little boys, and friendly
> meetings in the village where the first event of the program is
> always, \"Our  headman has a few words to say to you.\" There  must
> also be those wharfs down by the river where we bathe, where we can
> swim over to the other side and snatch a few ears of com to roast on
> an open fire and eat together. It is such a small world, isn\'t it,
> Sister Mai?

> [MAI  ]{.calibre4}[(smiles tolerantly): ]{.italic}No, Lanh, it is not
> a small world. The  strokes of your painting are those of love. Not
> only scenes of mountains or clouds or immense skies are breath taking.
> Lonely pines standing on snowy cliffs can also be free and bold. The
> world of the bodhisattvas also has lakes and ponds, low hills, curved
> bridges, and red earthen paths.

> [LANH  ]{.calibre4}[(mysteriously): ]{.italic}And highways.

> [MAl: ]{.calibre4}Yes, and highways. Because of love, you draw lemon
> trees,  fig trees,  bamboo  groves, and river wharfs. The longer the
> war lasts, the more hatred it creates, and love is being crushed
> underfoot. We see those dear to us unjustly destroyed and it is hard
> to keep our hearts peaceful so that love can survive. Using hatred to
> fight hatred is the surest way to create even more hatred. Those who
> create love are fewer and fewer, while those who create hate are more
> and more. And we are changed by it all. Simple, honest, close
> to-the-earth people, even after the war is over, will go on bearing
> the deep wounds inflicted by all this hatred.

> LANH: Isn\'t that the biggest concern? It must be better to be
> destroyed in a split second and then recreated, than to destroy all
> faith and love.

> TUAN: Yes, Lanh, that is our basic concern. I, myself, was born in
> 1945, the year of the revolution. The last of our family\'s three
> boys. As we grew up, all we saw was war and hatred. My hometown, Ben
> Tre, was where the energy and fervor of the revolution were in
> constant movement, much like the swift, deep water of the Tien  Giang
> River on its way to the sea. Fortunately, my family realized early on
> the necessity of love and encouraged me to follow my inclina tion for
> a monk\'s life. I went to the Buddhist Institutes of Giac Sanh, Tra
> Vinh, and later An Quang. Then I took up social studies and fieldwork.
> When  I worked hard, it was not because I had any illusion about my
> ability to change the situation. That  would have been like trying to
> extinguish a forest fire with a cup of water. But I did have faith
> then, and I still have faith now, that our work was of value because
> it sowed seeds of tolerance  and love in people\'s hearts.

> LANH: Let us hope that our earthly  lives, as well as our deaths, have
> sown the seeds of tolerance and love. Sister Mai\'s death, for
> instance, did not provoke any hatred. On the contrary, it awakened in
> many people the ability to un derstand and sacrifice, even people far
> away.

> [MAl: ]{.calibre4}We are approaching the  source  of the  river, my
> brothers. Have you noticed how thick the forest is getting?

> Hy: The  boat has been going fast, Sister Mai. Is Vui\'s village near

> [MAI: ]{.calibre4}Yes. In twenty kilometers, we will leave the boat
> for the jungle. The  current will be so strong  that it will be
> impossible for us to continue  to row upstream.

> [(Monkeys\' cries echo through  the forest)]{.italic}

> THO: Dawn is almost here, friends. Brother Tuan, look up at the great

> MAI [(smiles): ]{.italic}Of course it\'s Lien. \"Who else? Let\'s row

> The essence of nonviolence is love. Out of love and the willingness to
> act selflessly, strategies,  tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent
> struggle arise naturally. Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process.
> Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance,
> but a non violent one cannot  use such blind sources of energy, for
> they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself.
> Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by
> love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.

> The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and \'70s
> arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by
> international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside,  and
> people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and
> foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people\'s survival,
> we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and
> maintain the strictest  neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to
> speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as
> \"pro-communist  neutralists.\" Both warring parties claimed to speak
> for what the people really wanted, but the North  Vietnamese spoke for
> the communist  bloc and the South  Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist
>  bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to
> be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a \"victory\" by either
> side.  During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a
> monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children
> raising  their  bare hands against barbed  wire; students confronting
> military  police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and
> holding bayonets; young women running  through  clouds of tear gas
> with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently;
> monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above
> the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.

> Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the
> situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we
> inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from
> our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early
> twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for
> independence from the French,  and they won the support  of their
> countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that
> support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive
> resistance and undertake  positive efforts to over come the war and
> the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue  and Danang learned
>  that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops
> from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those
> cities brought  their family altars-the most sacred objects in their
> homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition  to
> oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying
> they used religion for political  purposes,  but I do not agree. They
>  were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront  the

> way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires
> someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire
> love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and
> sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc\'s act
> expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of
> others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the
> hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or
> program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the
> Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns,
> laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way,
> including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be
> \"a torch in the dark night.\"

> Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep
> Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the
> bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of
> her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She
> left behind letters to the Presidents  of North  and South Vietnam,
> imploring  them to stop the fighting.  She wrote one letter to me:
> \"Thay, don\'t worry too much. We will have peace soon.\" Nhat Chi Mai
> moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of
> love.

> I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for
> Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it
> was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks
> wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the
> hearts of the oppressors and call the world\'s attention  to the
> suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such
> unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination,
>  courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some
> Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots
> on his body with [[moxa ]{.italic}]{.calibre4}incense as he takes the
> 2[50 ]{.italic}vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to

> comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered
>  while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing  this
> kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and
> mind.

> The  Vietnamese   monks,  nuns,  and  laypeople  who burned themselves
> were saying with all their strength and determination that they were
> willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their
> people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The
> difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to
> death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but
> to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy,  but
> to create.  Suicide  is an act of self-destruction based on the
> inability to cope with life\'s difficulties. In Buddhism,
> self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions  of the
> precepts. Those  who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor
> hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous
> and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed
> themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I
> believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim
> at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy.
> Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance,  fanaticism,
> oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that  lay within the
> hearts of their fellow men and women.

> We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were
> used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our
> hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate
> techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to
> use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know
> what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have
> the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself.
> Then  everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence.
> Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and
> culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister
> Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to
> protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors
> and students followed suit. There  were labor strikes at the harbors
> and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University
> deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and
> university students  boycotted  classes and examinations. Draftees
> refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals.
> The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas,
> grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these
> nonviolent efforts.

> Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement,
> damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited
> extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and
> members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and
> non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned  or
> killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians,
> workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants
> were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social
> Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously
> wounded-all  because they refused to take sides in the war. In a
> memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS
> students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and
> neutrality: \"Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies
> are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who
> killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to
> embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways
> of working for the people of Vietnam.\"

> Despite  the  results-many years of war followed  by years of
> oppression and human rights abuse-1 cannot say that our struggle was a
> failure. The conditions for success in terms of a political victory
> were not present. But the success of a nonviolent struggle can be
> measured only in terms of the love and nonviolence attained, not
> whether a political victory was achieved. In our struggle in Vietnam,
> we did our best to remain true to our principles. We never lost sight

> \]ust this morning, the U.S. Consulate in Hue was destroyed by angry
> Vietnamese youths. In the past four days, five Vietnamese have
> immolated themselves, some of them leaving behind messages explaining
> that their actions were in protest against U.S. policy in South
> Vietnam. During my short visit to your country,  I have repeatedly
> been asked why the Vietnamese people seem to have become so strongly
> anti-American.

> I wish, first  of all, to assure you that  I am not  anti American.
> Indeed, it is precisely because I do have a great respect and
> admiration for America that I have undertaken this long voyage to your
> country,  a voyage that entails great personal risk for me upon my
> return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this risk willingly because I
> have faith that if the American public can begin to understand some
> thing of what the Vietnamese  people feel about what is happening in
> our country, much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery being endured
> by both our peoples might be eliminated.

> The demonstrations, self-immolations, and protests that we are
> witnessing in Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frustrations
> that the Vietnamese people feel at being so effectively excluded from
> participation in the determination of their country\'s future. Eighty
> years of French domination over Vietnam were ended by a long and
> bloody struggle waged and won by the Vietnamese people against
> overwhelming odds. During the twelve years since independence, most
> Vietnamese have remained without a voice in the nation\'s destiny, and
> this at a time when the nation is being subjected to a destructive
> force far surpassing anything ever before seen in our country. If
> anti-Americanism seems to be emerging  as a focus for some of the
> recent protests,  it is because the Vietnamese people recognize that
> it is really only the awesome U.S. power that enables the Saigon
> governments to rule without a popular mandate and to follow policies
> contrary  to the aspirations of the Vietnamese  people. This  is not
>  the independence for which the Vietnamese people fought so valiantly.

> The war in Vietnam today pits brother against brother, the Vietcong
> against the supporters of the Saigon government. Both sides claim to
> represent the Vietnamese people, but in reality neither  side does.
> The  most effective Vietcong propaganda says that the Saigon
> governments are mere puppets of the U.S., corrupt lackeys of the
> imperialists.

> Every escalation  of the war, every new contingent of U.S. troops
> confirms these charges and wins new recruits to the Vietcong,  for the
> overwhelming  majority  of the Vietnamese people now thirst
> desperately for peace and oppose any further expansion of the war.
> They see clearly that the present  policy of constant  escalation only
> puts peace ever further into the future and merely guarantees an even
> greater destruction of Vietnamese society. There  are now more than
> 300,000 Americans in my country, most of them knowing and caring
> little about our customs and practices and many of them involved in
> destroying Vietnamese people and property.

> This  creates friction  which generously  feeds the anti American
> propaganda,  and the fact that the war kills far more innocent
>  peasants than it does Vietcong is a tragic reality of life in the
> Vietnamese countryside. Those  who escape death by bombings must often
> abandon  their destroyed villages and seek shelter  in refugee camps
> where life is even more miserable than it was in the villages. In
> general, these people do not blame the Vietcong for their plight. It
> is the men in the planes, who drop death and destruction  from the
> skies, who appear to them to be their enemies. How can they see it
> otherwise?

> The United States chooses to support those elements in

> Vietnam that appear to be most devoted to the U.S.\'s wishes for
> Vietnam\'s future. But these elements have never been viewed by the
> Vietnamese people as their spokesmen. Diem was not, nor were Diem\'s
> successors. Thus,  it has been the U.S.\'s antipathy to popular
> government in South Vietnam, together  with its hope for an ultimate 
> military solution, that has not only contradicted the deepest
> aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but actually undermined the very
> objective for which we believe Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.

> To us, America\'s first objective is to have an anticommunist, or at
> least a non-communist, Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese people\'s
> objective is to have peace. They dislike communism, but they dislike
> war even more, especially after twenty years of fighting and
> bitterness which has rotted the very fabric of Vietnamese life.
> Equally important, we now see clearly that continuance of the war is
> more likely to spread communism in Vietnam than to contain it. The new
> social class of military officers and [[commerfants
> ]{.italic}]{.calibre4}that has been created as a direct result of the
> U.S. involvement, a class of sycophants who support the war for crass
> economic reasons, are not the people to whom Washington should listen
> if it sincerely wishes to hear the voice of South Vietnam. The
> Vietnamese people reject with scorn this corrupt  and self-seeking
> class that cares neither  for Vietnam nor for the great ideals of
> America, but thinks only of its own interests.

> The opinion is often expressed that there is no alternative to the
> present U.S. policy in Vietnam, neither on the political nor the
> military side. The non-communist alternatives to a military
> dictatorship  are said to be too fragmented  to offer a stable
> alternative, and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal  are considered
>  unfeasible  because it is feared that the Vietcong will take over the
> country by terror.

> The Vietnamese people recognize both of these dangers, but they also
> recognize  the utter  futility  of the present course and the
> catastrophic effects that it is having on our society. Furthermore, we
> do not agree that there is no alternative to a military dictatorship.
> The force of Vietnamese nationalism is such an alternative. Indeed,
> this is the sole force that can prevent the complete disintegration
>  of South Vietnam, and it is the force around which all Vietnamese can
> unite. But nationalism cannot attain its effective potential in the
> present Vietnamese political climate, where opposition to the
> government invites open persecution upon oneself and identification
> with it discredits one in the eyes of the people.

> More  than a decade of this atmosphere has served to drive many of the
> Vietnamese nationalists into the National Liberation Front, and many
> others of them into an ominous silence. Last year, an effort by a
> prominent group of nationalists  to circulate a mild petition
>  requesting  peace negotiations  between the South Vietnamese
> government and the NLF was so brutally attacked by the government that
> we are not likely to hear from them soon again, de spite their having
> attained some 5,000 signers in less than three days\' time.

> Today, the means for nationalist expression rests mainly with the
> Vietnamese Buddhists, who alone command sufficient popular support  to
> spearhead a protest for popular government. This  is not a new role
> for Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the Vietnamese  peasants,
> Buddhism and nationalism are inseparably entwined. The historic
> accident that made the popularization of Christianity in Vietnam
> coincident with France subjugation of Vietnam created this image.

> The repression of our faith by the French and by President Diem
> strengthened it. And today, when the Buddhist attempt  to give
> expression to the long pent-up wishes of the submerged and ignored
> Vietnamese masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the Vietnamese
> army, the Vietnamese people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly
> see whose action reflects our national heritage and whose action
> betrays this heritage.

> Thus, although  the Vietnamese  people may lose skirmishes because
> they have no foreign sources of support, the crude victories of the
> Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their credibility while
> confirming the Vietcong\'s propaganda claim that the government cares
> nothing about the people. The Buddhist efforts are designed not to
> weaken Vietnam\'s resistance but to create a genuine will to resist.

> Differences do exist among the Buddhists, the Catholics, and the other
> sects, but they would not be insurmountable if there were a climate in
> Vietnam that encouraged unity. But there are those who see a unified,
> popular, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a threat to themselves.
> Such persons help to sow disunity and then use the disunity which they
> create as a pretext for retaining power. No, we do not accept the
> evaluation  that there is no alternative to the present type of
> government.

> The second argument offered for continuing the present U.S. policy is
> that a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal would merely leave Vietnam to
> the communists. This argument we must also reject. The Vietcong grow
> stronger  because of the mistakes made by Saigon, not because of its
> communist ideology or its terror. If South Vietnam could achieve a
> government clearly responsive to the basic aspirations of the
> Vietnamese people and truly independent, there would no longer be any
> basis for popular support for the rebels. Indeed,  the rebels would
> have lost their reason to rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to
> continue, the Vietnamese people would have the will to resist it, for
> they could identify it as being hostile to Vietnamese nationalism,
> contrary to the people\'s longing for peace and reconstruction, and
> therefore of foreign inspiration.

> Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to
> outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam. Although
>  I am not a politician  and cannot therefore suggest every detail of a
> satisfactory settlement, the general direction that such a solution
> must take is quite clear to me and to many of the Vietnamese people.
> It does not involve the U.S. in any negotiations  with Hanoi, Peking,
> or the NLF. To the Vietnamese people, such talks, if necessary, are
> the proper province of Vietnamese officials rather than of Washington.

> My solution would be along the following lines:

> [1. A ]{.italic}[cessation of the bombing, north and south.]{.italic}

> [2. Limitation of all military operations by U.S. and South Vietnamese
> forces to defensive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Vietcong
> respond in kind.]{.italic}

> [3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its
> forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal
> actually beginning to take place as a sign of sin cerity.]{.italic}

> [4. A clear statement  by the U.S. of its desire to help the
> Vietnamese  people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese
> aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to implement  this statement,
> such as a refusal to support one group over another.]{.italic}

> [5. A generous effort to help rebuild, in light of the
> destruction]{.italic}

> [that has been wreaked upon Vietnam, such aid to be completely free of
> ideological and political strings and therefore not viewed as an
> affront to Vietnamese independence.]{.italic}

> Such a program, if implemented with sufficient vigor to convince  the
> now understandably skeptical Vietnamese people of its sincerity,
> offers the best hope for uniting them in a constructive effort and for
> restoring stability to South Vietnam.

> The plan is not perfect, for the question remains of how the U.S. can
> be sure that the South Vietnamese government and the Vietcong would
> cooperate in such a venture. Insofar as the South Vietnamese
> government is concerned, the past statements  of Premier  Ky have
> clearly indicated his unwillingness to seek a peaceful end to the war.
> In fact, it has been the contradiction between the aggressive words of
> Saigon and the peaceful statements of Washington that has so
> discredited the so-called U.S. peace offensive of last winter. The
>  withdrawal of the U.S. support  for Ky may thus be a necessary
> precondition for implementation of such a plan.

> It is obviously not possible to predict the response of the Vietcong
> to such a program, but the installation of a popular government in
> South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the beginning of an American
> withdrawal, would so undercut the Vietcong\'s position that it is
> likely to have no alternative but to cooperate.

> Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first
> step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the
> world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace.
> To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns.
> America\'s history suggests that she has the potential  to provide the
> world this leadership.

> [I]{.calibre2}n Vietnam, we take great risks publishing antiwar poems.
> Buddhists who have protested the war have been arrested and exiled,
> and are now being killed in Danang. Because of this great risk, the
> Buddhists who demonstrated this Spring were reluctant to advocate
> openly an end to the war through negotiations; instead, they called

> under take a peaceful political struggle with the communists, if only
> the destruction of the war can be stopped. We are confident  that the
> South .Vietnamese can protect  themselves from communist  domination
>  if we are allowed to carry out our political lives in peace.

> The  tragedy of American policy is that it has made such a peaceful
> political struggle very difficult. The Americans could have helped in
> reconstructing the country peacefully if they had cooperated with and
> strengthened the Buddhists and others who had the respect of the
> people. Instead, they have tried to divide the Buddhists to prevent
> them from becoming an organized force, and this has been disastrous.
> Catholicism came to Vietnam with the French, and the Catholic leaders,
> backed by the U.S., were objects of suspicion for most of the people.
> The Buddhist tradition is closely linked with nationalism, and it is
> unthinkable to the broad mass of people that the Buddhists would
> betray them to a foreign  power. At the same time, Vietnamese Buddhism
> is syncretic in character-there are Catholic priests who are closer to
> us on the question of peace than some of the older, more conservative
> Buddhist priests. (A few months  ago, eleven Catholic  priests issued
> a strong statement calling for peace, and they were attacked by the
> Catholic leaders.)

> Now the U.S. has become too afraid of the communists to allow a
> peaceful confrontation with them to take place, and when you are
> afraid, you cannot win. Sending 300,000

> American troops to Vietnam and bombing the countryside have only
> caused the communists to grow stronger. American military operations
> have killed and wounded more innocent peasants than Vietcong, and the
> Americans are blamed and hated for this. The peasants are not
> violently antagonistic to the Vietcong. The strong anticommunists are
> mostly people in the cities who fear the loss of their property, cars,
> businesses, and homes, and rely on the foreign army to protect them.
> The American soldiers, moreover, do not understand the Vietnamese. GIs
> make thousands of small mistakes every day that offend Vietnamese
> people. And the continual roaring overhead of U.S. planes on their way
> to drop bombs makes the people sick and angry.

> So it is understandable that the villagers distrust those who are
> connected with the South Vietnamese government and the Americans.
> Along with others, I helped organize a Buddhist School of Youth for
> Social Service, and we have trained thousands of young people to work
> at community development projects in the villages. We refuse to accept
> money from the government or the American Military Assistance Group.
> We go into the villages with nothing but our own robes, and we are
> warmly welcomed. The  peasants we work with tell us that the
> government officials assigned to \"assist\" them keep thousands of
> piasters a month for themselves and do nothing for them. They have
> come to dislike the Vietcong and fear the Americans, whose bombs
> continue to fall down on them.

> If the U.S. wants to escalate the war, we Vietnamese cannot stop you.
> Even changes of government will make no difference. The war will go
> on. Venerable Thich Tri Quang believes we may attain peace indirectly
> by means of political maneuvering and through elections. He is a man
> of action, courage, and intelligence, whose life is exemplary. But
> other Buddhists are trying to create a new Buddhist path emphasizing
> ways of helping the people who live on the land. I myself doubt that
> much will be gained by indirect political maneuvering against the
> government and the Catholics, as long as the U.S. is determined to
> continue the war. Underlying  our struggles with the government  in
> Danang and other cities is the unstated question of whether the war
> will go on, and this only the U.S. can decide. I believe the most
> effective thing we can do is advocate peace, however dangerous that
> may be, by telling the world that we do not accept this war, that the
> communists are growing stronger every day it continues to be fought,
>  and that a cease-fire  must be arranged  with the Vietcong as soon as
> possible. Then we would welcome the help of Americans in the peaceful
> reconstruction of our country. Only America has the capability of
> stopping this war, which is destroying not only our lives, but our
> culture and everything of human value.

> The  poems that follow are not typical of my own poetry or of
> Vietnamese poetry generally. The tradition of poetry in Vietnam is
> very old and complex. It draws on early Chinese poetry, on the French
> Romantic and symbolist poets of the nineteenth and twentieth
> centuries, and, in my own case, on Zen Buddhist writers. Much of my
> poetry could be called \"philosophical,\" and friends  have found  it
> in some ways similar to the work of Tagore; at least, it is extremely
> difficult to translate into English.

> But these poems are different. They are popular poems

> in free verse, and when I write them I am trying to speak very simply
> for the majority of Vietnamese, who are peas ants and cannot speak for
> themselves. They do not know or care much about words like
> \"communism\" or \"democracy,\" but only want the war to end so they
> can survive. I wrote these poems first for myself; when I read them I
> can regain the state of intense  feeling in which I composed them.
> They have now been read and heard by many Vietnamese;  and they have
> been denounced by both  sides fighting in the war. A few days after
> they were published last year, government police came to seize them
> from the bookstores, but by then they had all been sold. They were

> [Ahimsa: The Path of Harmlessness]{.calibre3}

 

 

 

> The Sanskrit word [ahimsa, ]{.italic}usually translated
>  \"nonviolence,\" literally means \"non-harming\" or \"harmlessness.\"
> To practice ahimsa, first of all we have to practice it within
> ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a
> certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our
> response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take
> pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that
> the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny
> microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being
> vegetarian, we are going in the direction  of non violence. If we want
> to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is
> impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed
> in that direction.

> Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even soldiers. Some army
> generals, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid
> killing innocent people; this is a kind of nonviolence. To help
> soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with
> them. If we divide reality into two camps-the violent and the
> nonviolent-and stand in one camp while attacking  the other,  the
> world will never have peace. We will always blame and condemn those we
> feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without
> recognizing  the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on
> ourselves and also work with those we condemn if we want to have a
> real impact. It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as
> enemies, even  those  who act violently. We have  to approach  them
>  with love in our  hearts  and do our  best to help them move in a
> direction  of nonviolence. If we work for peace out of anger, we will
> never succeed. Peace is not an end.  It can never  come  about
>  through non-peaceful means. When  we protest against a war, we may
> assume that we are a peaceful  person,  a representative of peace,
>  but this might  not be the case. If we look deeply, we will observe
> that  the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have been living.
> We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves
>  and others, therefore we are co-responsible: \"Because I have been
> like this, they are like that.\" A more holistic approach  is the way
> of \"interbeing\": \"This  is like this, because that is like that.\"
> This  is the way of understanding and love. With  this insight, we can
> see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go to a
> demonstration and say, \"This war is unjust, destructive,  and not
> worthy of our great nation.\" This is far more effective than angrily
> condemning others. Anger always accelerates the damage.

> We know how to write strong  letters  of protest,  but we must also
> learn  to write love letters  to our President  and Representatives,
> demonstrating the kind of understanding and using the kind of language
>  they will appreciate. If we don\'t, our letters may end up in the
> trash and help no one. To love is to understand. We cannot express
> love to someone unless we understand him or her. If we do not
> understand our President  or Congressperson, we cannot write him or
> her a love letter.

> People are happy to read a good letter in which we share our insights
>  and our understanding. When  they receive that kind of letter, they
> feel understood and they will pay attention to your recommendations.
> You may think that the way to change the world is to elect a new
> President, but a government is only a reflection of society, which is
> a reflection of our own consciousness. To create fundamental change,
> we, the members of society, have to transform ourselves. If we want
> real peace, we have to demonstrate our love and understanding so that
> those responsible for making decisions can learn from us.

> All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry and
> frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is
> capable of understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there
> is a bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara who has 1,000 arms and 1,000
> hands, and has an eye in the palm of each hand. One thousand hands
> represent action, and the eye in each hand represents understanding.
>  When you understand  a situation  or a person, any action you do will
> help and will not cause more suffering. When  you have an eye in your
> hand, you will know how to practice true nonviolence.

> Imagine if each of our words also had an eye in it. It is

> easy to depict a hand with an eye, but how might an artist also put an
> eye into our words? Before we say something, we have to understand
> what we are saying and the person to whom our words are directed. With
>  the eye of understanding, we will not say things to make the other
> person suffer. Blaming and arguing are forms of violence. When we
> speak, if we suffer greatly, our words may be bitter, and that will
> not help anyone. We have to learn to calm our selves and become a
> flower before we speak. This is \"the art of loving speech.\"

> Listening is also a deep practice. The  bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara
> has a deep talent for listening. In Chinese, his name means
> \"listening to the cries of the world.\" We have to listen in a way
> that we understand the suffering of others. We have to empty ourselves
> and leave space so we can listen well. If we breathe in and out to
> refresh and empty ourselves, we will be able to sit still and listen
> to the person who is suffering. When she is suffering, she needs
> someone to listen attentively without judging or reacting. If she
> cannot find someone in her family, she may go to a psychotherapist.
> Just by listening deeply, we already alleviate a great  deal of her
> pain. This  is an important practice  of peace. We have to listen in
> our families and in our communities. We have to listen to everyone,
> especially those we consider our enemies. When we show our capacity of
> listening and understanding, the other person will also listen to us,
> and we will have a chance to tell him of our pain. This is the
> beginning of healing.

> Thinking is at the base of everything. It is important for us to put
> an eye of awareness into each of our thoughts. Without a correct
> understanding of a situation or a person, our thoughts can be
> misleading and create confusion, de spair, anger, or hatred. Our most
> important task is to de velop correct insight. If we see deeply into
> the nature of interbeing, that all things \"inter-are,\" we will stop
> blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with
> everyone.

> These  are the three domains of action-body, speech, and mind. In
> addition, there is [non-action, ]{.italic}which is often more
> important than action. Without our doing anything, things can
> sometimes go more smoothly  just because of our peaceful presence. In
> a small boat when a storm comes, if one person remains solid and calm,
> others will not panic, and the boat is more likely to stay afloat. In
> many circumstances, non-action can help a lot. A tree merely breathes,
> waves its leaves and branches, and tries to stay fresh. But if the
> tree were not there, we could not be here. The  tree\'s non-action is
> fundamental to our welbeing. If we can learn to live the way a tree
> does-staying fresh and solid, peaceful and calm-even if we do not do
> many things, others will benefit from our non-action, our presence. We
> can also practice non-action  in the domain of speech. Words can
> create understanding and mutual acceptance, or they can cause others
> to suffer. Sometimes it is best not to say anything. This is a book on
> nonviolent social action, but we must also discuss nonviolent
>  non-action. If we really want to help the world, the practice of
> non-action is essential.

> Of course, sometimes non-action can be harmful. When someone needs our
> help and we refuse, she may die. If a monk, for example, sees a woman
> drowning and does not want to touch her because of his precepts, he
> will violate the most fundamental principle of life. When we see
> social injustice, if we practice non-action, we may cause harm. When
> people need us to say or do something, if we don\'t, we can kill by
> our inaction or our silence.

> To practice ahimsa, we must first of all learn ways to deal peacefully
> with ourselves. If we create true harmony within ourselves, we will
> know how to deal with family, friends, and associates. Techniques  are
> always secondary. Most important is to become ahimsa, so that when a
> situation  presents itself, we will not create  more suffering. To
> practice ahimsa, we need gentleness, loving kindness, compassion, joy,
> and equanimity directed to our  bodies, our  feelings, and other
>  people.

> Real peace must be based on insight and understanding, and  for this
> we must  practice deep  reflection-looking deeply into each act and
> each thought  of our daily lives.

> With  mindfulness-the practice of peace-we can begin by working  to
> transform the wars in ourselves. There are techniques  for doing this.
> Conscious  breathing is one. Every time we feel upset, we can stop
> what we are doing, refrain from saying anything,  and breathe in and
> out several times, aware of each in-breath and each out-breath. If we
> are still upset, we can go for walking meditation, mindful of each
> slow step and each breath  we take. By cultivating peace within,  we
> bring about  peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in
> ourselves is to minimize the numbers of wars between this and that
> feeling, or this and that perception, and we can then have real peace
> with others as well, including  the members of our own family.

> I am often  asked, \"What if you are practicing love and

> patience  and someone  breaks into your house and tries to kidnap your
> daughter or kill your husband?  What should you do? Should  you shoot
>  that person or act in a nonviolent way?\" The  answer depends  on
> your state of being. If you are prepared, you may react calmly and
> intelligently, in the most nonviolent  way possible. But to be ready
> to react with intelligence  and nonviolence, you have to train
> yourself in advance. It may take ten years, or longer. If you wait
> until  the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too late. A
> this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial
> moment, even if you know that nonviolence  is better than violence, if
> your understanding is only intellectual and not in your whole being,
> you will not act nonviolently. The fear and anger  in you will prevent
> you from acting in the most nonviolent  way.

> To prevent war, to prevent the next crisis, we must begin

> right  now. When a war or a crisis has begun,  it is already too late.
> If we and our children practice ahimsa in our daily lives, if we learn
> how to plant seeds of peace and reconciliation in our own hearts and
> minds, we will begin to establish real peace and, in that way, we may
> be able to prevent the next war. If another war does come, we will
> know that we have done our best. Is ten years enough  time to prepare
> ourselves and our nation to avoid another  war? How much time does it
> take to breathe consciously, to smile, and to be fully present in each
> moment?  Our real enemy is forgetfulness. If we nourish mindfulness
> every day and water  the seeds of peace in ourselves and those around
>  us, we have a good chance to prevent the next war and to defuse the
> next crisis.

> Immediately after ordering the ground attack on Iraq, in February
> 1991, President  Bush addressed his nation, saying, \"Whatever you are
> doing at this moment, please stop and pray for our soldiers in the
> Gulf. God Bless the United States  of America.\"  I suspect  that at
> the same moment many Moslems were also praying to their God to protect
> Iraq and the Iraqi soldiers. How could God know which nation to
> support? Many people pray to God because they want God  to fulfill
> some of their needs. If they want to have a picnic, they may ask God
> for a clear, sunny day. At the same time, farmers who need more rain
> might pray for the opposite. If the weather is clear, the picknickers
> may say, \"God is on our side; he answered our prayers.\" But if it
> rains, the farmers will say that God heard  [their  ]{.italic}prayers.
> This is the way we usually pray.

> In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught, [\"Blessed are]{.italic}

> [the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\"
> ]{.italic}Those who work for peace must have a peaceful  heart. When
> you have a peaceful heart, you are the child of God. But many who work
> for peace are not at peace. They still have anger and frustration, and
> their work is not really peaceful. We cannot say that they belong to
> the Kingdom of God.

> To preserve peace, our hearts must be at peace with the world, with
> our brothers and our sisters. When we try. To overcome evil with evil,
> we are not working for peace. If you say, \"Saddam Hussein is evil. We
> have to prevent him from continuing  to be evil,\" and if you then use
> the same means he has been using, you are exactly like him. Trying to
> overcome evil with evil is not the way to make peace.

> Jesus also said, [\"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill
> shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever
> is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the
> judgment \... whosoever shall say, \'Thou fool,' shalt be in danger of
> hell fire.\"]{.italic}

> Jesus did not say that if you are angry with your brother, you will be
> put in a place called hell. He said that if you are angry with your
> brother, you are already in hell. Anger [is ]{.italic}hell. He also
> said that you don\'t need to kill with your body to be put in jail.
> You need only to kill in your mind and you are already there.

> In the Persian  Gulf, many people practiced  killing in their
> minds-Iraqi, American, French, British, and other soldiers. They knew
> that if they didn\'t kill, the enemy sol diers would kill them, so
> they used sandbags to represent their enemy, and holding their
> bayonets firmly, they ran, shouted, and plunged  the  bayonets  into
>  the sandbags. They  practiced killing day and night in their hearts
> and minds. The damage caused by that kind of practice is huge. I
> happened to see a few seconds of that kind of practice on TV. Even if
> President Bush had not given the order for a land offensive, a lot of
> damage was already being done in the minds and hearts of one million
> people in the Gulf. Those kinds of wounds last for a long time and are
> transmitted  to future generations. If you train yourself every day to
> kill during the day and then dream of killing during the night because
> you have spent so much time concentrating on that, the damage is deep.
> If you survive, you will bear that kind of scar for many years. This
> is a real tragedy. We usually count  bodies to measure the damage from
> a war, but we don\'t count these kinds of wounds in the hearts and
> minds of so many soldiers. We have to see the real long-term damage
> that war causes. Soldiers live in hell day and night, even before they
> go into the battlefield, and even after they return home.

> We may think of peace as the absence of war, that if the great powers
> would reduce their weapons arsenals, we could have peace. But if we
> look deeply into the weapons, we will see our own minds-our own
> prejudices, fears, and ignorance.  Even if we transport all the  bombs
> to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of the bombs are still
> here-in our hearts and minds-and, sooner or later, we will make new
> bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the
> hearts of men and women. To start a war and give the opportunity to
> one million men and women to practice killing day and night in their
> hearts is to plant many, many seeds of war-anger, frustration, and the
> fear of being killed. I felt very sad when I learned that more than
> eighty percent of the American people supported the Gulf War.

> [\"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
> tooth for a tooth. But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but
> whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
> also. And ]{.italic}[[if ]{.italic}]{.calibre3}[any man will sue thee
> at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak

> This is Jesus\' teaching about revenge. \"When someone asks you for
> something, give it to him. When he wants to borrow something from you,
> lend it to him. How many Christians actually practice this? There  is
> a story about an American soldier who was taking a Japanese prisoner
> during World War II. While walking together, the American discovered
> that the Japanese soldier spoke English and that he had been a
> Christian before he abandoned his faith. So he asked, \"Why did you
> abandon Christianity? It is an excellent religion,\" and the Japanese
> man said, \"I could not become a soldier and continue  to be a
> Christian. I don\'t think a good Christian  can become a soldier and
> kill another person.\" He understood this passage from Matthew. There
>  must be ways to solve our conflicts without having to resort to
> killing. We must focus our attention  on this. We have to find ways to
> help people get out of difficult situations, situations of conflict,
> without having to kill.

> [[\"Ye ]{.italic}]{.calibre3}[have heard that it hath been said, Thou
> shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,
> Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them  that

> he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
> rain on the just and on the unjust.\"]{.italic}

> This is nondiscrimination. When you pray only for your own picnic and
> not for the farmers who need the rain, you are doing the opposite  of
> what Jesus taught. Jesus said, \"Love your enemies, bless them that
> curse you\...\" When we look deeply into our anger, we see that the
> person we call our enemy is also suffering. As soon as we see that, we
> have the capacity of accepting and having compassion for him. Jesus
> called this \"loving your enemy.\" When we are able to love our enemy,
> he or she is no longer our enemy. The  idea of \"enemy\" vanishes and
> is replaced by the no tion of someone suffering a great deal who needs
> our com passion. Doing  this is sometimes  easier than we might think,
> but we need to practice. If we read the Bible but don\'t practice, it
> will not help much.

> [\"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against

> that  some  of our  actions  in the  past may have caused others to

> forgiving. We want to begin anew. \"You, my brother or sister, have

> understand  what has happened can you have compassion for the other
>  person and forgive him or her.

> If President  Bush had had more understanding of the mind of President

> and many lives could have been spared. But because anger was there,

> on the side of America.

> Eighty percent of the American people called the Persian Gulf War a
> victory-only a few hundred  American soldiers were killed. But every
> human life is precious, and the loss of the 100,000 or more Iraqi
> people was a great tragedy! You may identify yourself as an American,

> civilians are also casualties that America suffered,  because their
> death was your country\'s work. When President Bush said, \"God bless
> the United States of America,\" he was not paying enough attention to
> the lives of non-Americans. To those of us who are not American, this
> was not a good image of America. It was selfish and arrogant, and this
> was also a casualty that America suffered-not just by guns and bombs,
> but by your President\'s statement. If the President had said, \"God
> bless us so that the war will end soon and that Americans as well as
> Iraqis will suffer as little as possible,\" he could have won a lot
> more sympathy from people around the world. But he did not say that.

> Who is President Bush? President Bush is us. We are responsible  for
> the way he feels, for everything he does. Eighty percent of the people
> in America supported him in this just war. Why blame him? Our capacity

> overwhelmed.

> After the parades ended and the yellow ribbons were no longer there,
> what did we have? What did the wives, husbands, children, brothers,
> and sisters of the soldiers receive when their  loved ones returned
> from the Gulf after so much fear, hatred, and killing-in reality and
> in their daily practice? We cannot imagine the long-term effects of
> watering so many seeds of war.

> Please sit still, breathe, and look deeply, and you will see the real
> losses, the real casualties that America suffered and continues to
> suffer from the Gulf War. Visualize 500,000 allied soldiers stationed
> in Saudi Arabia, waiting for the order to invade Iraq, jumping and
> screaming as they plunge their bayonets into sandbags that represent
> Iraqi soldiers. You cannot plunge a bayonet into a person without
> first transforming yourself into a beast. On the other side, one
> million Iraqi soldiers were practicing the same. One and a half
> million solders were practicing violence, hatred, and fear, and the
> American public supported  them to do so. They thought that this war
> was somehow clean, quick, and moral. They saw only bridges and
> buildings  being destroyed, but the real casualties were the souls of
> the men and women who came home after practicing violence for so many
> months.

> How could they do that and remain themselves? When they returned,  the
> soldiers cried for joy; they were alive! Their  parents, wives,
> husbands, children, and friends also cried for joy. But after one or
> two weeks, the war welled up from within their deepest consciousness,
> and their families and the whole of society will have to endure their

> children are unhappy, they will look for other things that are exactly
> like war-alcohol, drugs, and some TV  programs,  magazines, films, and
> other  violent \"cultural products.\"

> Our society is sick. When we put a young person in this society
> without trying to protect him or her, he or she will receive violence,
> hatred, and fear every day and get sick. Our conversations, our TV
> programs, our advertisements, our newspapers, our magazines all water
> the seeds of suffering in young people and not-so-young people.

> How can we transform our individual consciousness and the collective
> consciousness of our society? How can we refrain from consuming more
> toxic cultural products? We need guidelines-a diet-and we need to
> practice watering the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness in ourselves.
> The most important practice for preventing war is to stay in touch
> with what is refreshing, healing, and joyful inside us and all around
> us. If we practice walking mindfully, being in touch with the earth,
>  the air, the trees, and ourselves, we can heal ourselves, and our
> entire society will also be healed. If the whole nation would practice
> watering seeds of joy and peace and not just seeds of anger and
> violence, the elements of war in all of us will be transformed.

> We must prepare ourselves, whether we have one minute, ten years, or
> one thousand  years. If we don\'t  have time, there is no use in
> discussing peace, because you cannot practice peace without  time. If
> you have one minute, please use that minute  to breathe  in and out
> calmly and plant the seeds of peace and understanding in yourself. If
> you have ten years, please use the ten years to prevent the next war.
> If you have one thousand  years, please use the time to prevent the
> destruction of our planet.

>  Transformation  is possible, but it takes time. There are already
> seeds of peace in those we call \"hawks,\" but they need us to water
> their seeds of peace and understanding or else their seeds of anger

> discouraged. Just by your way of looking at things and doing things,
> you influence others. Approach everyone with love and patience, and
> try to water the positive seeds in them. We have to help each other,
> being skillful, kind, and understanding. Blaming and arguing never
> help.

> People everywhere saw the Los Angeles policemen beating Rodney King.
> When I first saw that video on French Tv, I felt that I was the one
> being beaten, and I suffered a lot. I think you must have felt the
> same. All of us were beaten at the same time. We were all victims of
> violence, anger, misunderstanding, and the lack of respect for our
> human dignity.

> But as I looked more deeply, I saw that the policemen beating Rodney
> King were no different from myself. They were doing it because our
> society is filled with hatred and violence. Everything is like a bomb
> ready to explode, and we are all a part of that bomb; we are all
> co-responsible. We are all the policemen [and ]{.italic}the victim.

> In the practice of mindfulness, we nurture the ability to see deeply
> into  the nature  of things and people, and the fruit is insight,
> understanding,  and love. Because we have not practiced deeply enough,
> violence has become the substance of our society. Putting the
> policemen in jail will not solve this fundamental  problem. We accept
> violence as a way of life and as a way to deal with problems. If we
> are not mindful-if we do not transform our shared suffering through
>  compassion and deep understanding-then one day our child will be the
> one who is beaten, or the one doing the beating. It is very much our

> On the final day of a mindfulness retreat for 200 Americans in
> Massachusetts, Jon  Kabat-Zinn read an insight poem that said, \"The
> Vietnam War ends today.\" That  was in 1987, and since then, I have
> begun to lead retreats for war veterans. I want veterans to realize
> how important they are.

> I, too, am a veteran. I lost many friends-many brothers and
> sisters-during the Vietnam War, and I experienced much suffering.
> Grenades were thrown into my room, but were deflected by a curtain.
> Social service workers under my direction were killed and maimed. We
> did our best to confront the violence with love, but we had to cry a
> lot.

> I have been practicing to transform  my suffering  and share my
> insight with others. I do not feel any more blame. I feel peace and
> compassion, and that allows me to help other people.

> Veterans are the light at the tip of the candle, illuminating the way
> for the whole nation. If veterans can achieve awareness,
> transformation, understanding, and peace, they can share with the rest
> of society the realities of war. And they can teach us how to make
> peace with ourselves and each other, so we never have to use violence
> to resolve conflicts again. To make the world a peaceful place, to
> ensure for our children and grandchildren  a life worth living, we
> need a transformation.

> When  you touch fire and your hand gets burned, it is not the
> responsibility of the hand alone. It is the responsibility of the
> whole person. The hand did not touch the fire by itself. It was
> commanded to do so by the brain, and the whole body got hurt at the
> same time. If the body blames the hand, that is not just. The hand
> acted because the body ordered  it to do so. When  there is good
> communication between the hand and the rest of the body, both the hand
> and the body will feel better. If the body says, \"You must bear the
> burden of your actions by yourself; I cannot for give what you have
> done,\" that is the lack of understand ing.

> When you went to war, you went for the whole nation. The whole nation
>  was responsible for what happened there, not you alone. Your hand was
> the hand of the whole nation. If you made mistakes, the whole nation
> made mistakes. If you went to war believing you were doing something
> important-trying to save a people, fighting evil-it was not your
> thinking  alone; it was the thinking  of the whole nation. You were
> sent there to fight, destroy, kill, and die. You were not the only one
> responsible. We cannot just shout at you and say, \"You did that!\" We
> all did it collectively.

> Our individual consciousness is a product of our society, ancestors,
> education, and many other factors. Your sense of duty, service, and
> freedom were handed to you by society, and you went to war as
> representatives of your people, not just as individuals. You have to
> look deeply to understand what really happened. Your personal healing
> will be the healing of the whole nation, your children, and their
> children.

> When the hand gets burned, if there is good communication with the
> rest of the body, blood and other fluids will rush to the wound and
> begin the process of healing. If the nation comes to understand the
> true nature of the war, loving kindness will begin to surface, and
> healing will begin. As long as there is no communication, there is no
> insight or compassion, and you will continue to suffer. Non-veterans
> do not understand veterans, and they refuse to listen to you. You know
> the truth about war, but you have not been able to share your insight
> with them. You have suffered so much, but you have not been able to
> find ways to tell people about it, and they have not been ready to
> listen.

> You continue to suffer, because you feel guilty about your actions in
> Vietnam. Shame, guilt, and regret can be helpful or harmful; it
> depends how you use them. When you realize that you have caused a lot
> of damage, if you vow not to do it again, that regret is wholesome and
> beneficial. But if your guilt persists for too long and becomes a
> complex, it blocks the way to joy and peace. The  way to liberate
>  yourself is to look deeply into the nature  of the guilt and
> self-hatred  and see the seeds of the suffering your ancestors, your
> parents, and the violence and lack of understanding in our society and
> its institutions. If you went to Vietnam with such a heritage of
> suffering, your actions were dictated  by those forces. That is also
> true of those who opposed the war.

> The  seeds  of suffering come  from  many directions. When your
> parents conceived you, you already had many seeds of happiness and
> suffering handed down by your ancestors. In your mother\'s womb, you
> received more seeds. If your  parents were  not  happy  together, you
>  received seeds of suffering.

> As you grew up, if your parents  argued  and made each other  unhappy,
> you received those seeds of suffering,  too. If your  parents were
> alcoholic, they  made you suffer. If your father abused you, you
> suffered. Violent films and TV programs also watered  the seeds of
> fear and hatred in you. By the time you became a soldier, you were
> already filled with suffering. Then, in the army you were told that
>  the Vietnamese were beasts and you had to kill them. You cannot kill
> another human  being without visualizing him as a beast. The  mass
> media reinforced  this image, watering  the seeds of hatred and fear
> in order  to help you kill. So many seeds of violence  were watered
>  before  you were a soldier and during the time you were a soldier.

> With  such a heritage of suffering, it is no surprise that you
> committed atrocities during the war. You knew you could be killed at
> any time. You saw your friends killed in ambushes. You became  more
>  and more  angry  and  more and more afraid. You may have killed
> children and women. You may have raped  women  or destroyed villages
> out of the fear, hatred,  and rage that were pouring  into you from so
> many directions. If you committed atrocities in Vietnam, it was the
> act of everyone-your father  who abused you, the  press, your
>  commander, everyone who watered the seeds of anger in you so that you
> could kill.

> We do not need to go overseas to a war zone to see such violence. The
> Los Angeles policemen beating Rodney King,  that  was also Vietnam.
> War  manifests itself  in so many ways here and now. It is a
> reflection of our collective consciousness, which  is filled  with
>  suffering. With this heritage, the violence  will repeat  itself 
> over and over. There will be other Vietnams, other Gulf Wars. It is
> our task to look deeply into the violence, hatred, and fear to see
> their roots.

> Many soldiers who went to Vietnam had almost no contact with the
> Vietnamese  people,  culture, or life. They were told that the
> Vietnamese needed to be killed because they were evil and they were
> killers. Because it was a high-tech war, you just pushed buttons  to
> complete  many of your missions. You did not know or see the damage
> you were inflicting on the people and the country of Vietnam. If you
> flew one hundred  missions, you might have been successful as a
> soldier, but you did not know what was happening on the ground,
> because you were so far away. Once you realized what was happening on
> the ground, you began to have guilt.

> Who did that bombing? Your President, your Congress,

> your Senate,  your  people, everyone.  You were only the hand ordered
>  to do it. Why keep the regret for yourself? Why keep the shame for
> yourself? When you begin to see that, you will be free, and we need
> you to share your insight  with everyone  so we will not be tempted
>  to do it again.

> When you came home after the war, the American people were cool,
> neglectful, and unappreciative, and of course you became angry. But
> your people did not know anything about  the war. Both hawks and doves
> had a very wrong view. You experienced the reality firsthand, and when
> you see that they were speaking out of ignorance, you will stop being
> angry at them. You were ignorant  too, but now you have learned, and
> you are liberated from your anger. Now you can offer your compassion.

> We who have experienced war directly have a responsibility to share
> our insight and experience concerning  the truth of war. We are the
> light at the tip of the candle. It is very hot, but it has the power
> of shining and illuminating. We can gather into groups to support each
> other. Practicing mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into
> the nature of the war and, with our insight, awaken our own people. We
> know what war is. We also know that the war is not only in us; it is
> in everyone-veterans and non-veterans. We must share our insight, not
> out of anger, but out of love. Our people need us to do it. I am
> trying my best, and I hope my friends will do the same.

> During the war, one portion of the American population had to confront
> one portion of the Vietnamese population. These were the soldiers, the
> combatants. But the combatants and the non-combatants were not so
> different. In both, there were conflicts, and we have to look deeply
> to recognize these conflicts so that we can transform  them into
> understanding and compassion,  the fruit of insight. Insight can be
> brought about by mindfulness and looking deeply. If we do not have
> enough  mindfulness,  if we do not make enough  effort to look deeply,
> we will not have enough insight to transform  the conflicts that are
> within us, not to mention  those between people and those with other
> nations.

> The  basic condition for happiness is to be understood. Our  pain,
> hope, and despair  have to be understood  by someone for us to be
> happy. Vietnam veterans do not feel understood by their society, not
> even by members of their own  families.  Consciously or
>  unconsciously, veterans blame  the  non-veterans for  not
>  understanding them. There is so much misunderstanding to be
> dissolved. Veterans have suffered so much, and they have to take the
> time to understand their  own suffering. It may look as if the people
> of America understand  Gulf War veterans better, but I don\'t think
> so. Our ignorance about the nature of war is exactly the same. The war
> in Vietnam and the war in the Gulf were the same. It does not change
>  just by the way people welcome you back. Whether they shout at you or
> wave flags and welcome you, the true nature of the war is the same. We
> have to see that.

> Many years have now passed since the Vietnam War. We are calm enough
> to realize that the Vietnam War was not necessary. We spent so much
> energy, so many human lives-millions of people died in Vietnam. There
> are still a lot of mines and bombs in Vietnam that have not been
> defused, and there are also many bombs in our souls that have not been
> defused. We need to defuse the bombs in our souls first. Then we can
> go to Vietnam to help defuse the bombs there.

> When we look deeply, we can see that all wars have their roots in the
> lack of understanding. We may be a little wiser now that twenty years
> have passed since the Vietnam War, but are we wise enough to prevent
> another war? In fact, we have already had another unnecessary war. In
> order to prevent yet another, we have to be prepared. We need time, of
> course, but we also need a way. If we know what to do, how to prepare,
> time is of secondary importance. We have to practice in a way that
> helps the whole nation see deeply into the nature of war.

> When  you look into your consciousness  and see your own pain, you
> also see the suffering and confusion of your society and your
> government. You have been embracing your suffering for many years, but
> when you see it directly, [it ]{.italic}will transform itself into a
> positive source of energy that will empower you to share your insight.
> To help others, we have to go to them with arms extended, filled with
> loving kindness and compassion. Blaming others or blaming ourselves
> can never help. The moment we have this insight, we will stop blaming,
> we will stop suffering, and we will have the energy to serve our
> people, even [if ]{.italic}they are still ignorant about the nature of
> the war.

> No one ever wins a war. The Vietnamese did not win the war. Millions
> of people in Vietnam are still suffering, and the country has been
> destroyed. Vietnam did not win anything. We cannot call it a victory.
> You cannot call the Gulf War a victory either. But many Americans did
> call it a victory, so they could have the feeling once again that

> welcoming the soldiers back, trying to overcome what they called a

> I don\'t see any difference between a Vietnam veteran and a Gulf War

> As long as the American people believe that  the Gulf War was moral,

> Twenty years ago, I wrote four Chinese characters on a paper

> It was 1976, and several of us were conducting an operation to rescue

> The practice was to push the boat people back out to sea so they would

> We hired two large ships-the [Leapdal ]{.italic}and the [Roland

> I decided to practice the meditation topic, \"If you want peace, peace

> Practicing the topic, \"If you want peace, peace is with you

> native mountain people for their help, and two Montagnards  from the
> Jarai tribe joined us in clearing the forest, cutting trees into

> Many people criticized the Montagnards for this ethic.

> They said that this laziness could only lead to trouble, and they

> [1. The Montagnards  would be happier and more comfortable

> The Montagnards lived simply. They did not store much food at all.
> They had no bank accounts.  But they were much more serene and at

> wisdom contained in a life-style like this, a wisdom that those of us
> immersed  in modernization and economic  growth have lost.

> How much stuff do we need to be happy and comfortable? Happiness and
> comfort vary according to taste. Some people think they need three or
> four houses-one on the Riviera, one in New York, one in Tokyo, and
> perhaps one in Fiji. Others find that a two or three-room hut is quite
> enough. In fact, if you own a dozen luxurious houses, you may rarely
> have time to enjoy them. Even when you have the time, you may not know
> how to sit peacefully in one place. Always seeking distraction-going
> to restaurants, the theater, or dinner parties, or taking vacations
> that exhaust you even more, you can\'t stand being alone and facing
> yourself directly.

> In former times, people spent hours drinking one cup of tea with dear
> friends. A cup of tea does not cost much, but today, we go to a cafe
> and take less than five minutes  to drink our tea or coffee, and even
> during that short time, we are mostly thinking and talking about other

> barely have the time to live in it. We leave home early in the morning

> home exhausted, eat dinner, watch TV, and collapse so we can get up
> early for work. Is this \"progress\"?

> The Montagnards  were quite content to live in simple bamboo  and
> palm-leaf  huts and wash their  clothes  by hand. They  refused to be

> Of course, the Montagnards could have spent more time working in order
> to send aid to people who were starving in other parts of the world.
> If they did not do so, it was because they didn\'t know much about the

> members whenever they got sick or when a crop was destroyed by some
> natural disaster. But let us reflect for a moment on[ ]{.italic}what
> the Montagnard people did [not ]{.italic}do.

> They did not harm or exploit others. They grew their own food and
> exchanged some of their products with other people. They did not do

> They  cleared  only enough land to plant their crops. Because of their
> simple life-style,  they did not overconsume natural  resources. They
> did not pollute the air, water, or soil. They used very little fuel
> and no electricity. They did not own private cars, dishwashers, or
> electric razors. The way they lived enabled natural resources to
> continually renew themselves. A lifestyle like theirs demonstrates
> that a future for humankind is possible, and this is the most helpful
> thing anyone can do to help others.

 

> [4. If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend

> It is true that the Montagnards were exploited by others and were
> often victims of social injustice. They lived in re mote mountain

> People said that if the rest of us in Vietnam worked as little as they

> When I first left Vietnam, I had a dream in which I was a young  boy,
> smiling  and at ease, in my own land, surrounded by my own people, in
> a time of peace. There  was a beautiful hillside, lush with trees and
> flowers, and on it was a little house. But each time I approached the
> hillside, obstacles prevented me from climbing it, and then I woke up.

> The  dream recurred many times. I continued to do my work and to
> practice mindfulness,  trying to be in touch with the beautiful trees,
> people, flowers, and sunshine that surrounded me in Europe  and North
> America. I looked deeply at these things, and I played under the trees
> with the children exactly as I had in Vietnam. Mter a year, the dream
>  stopped. Seeds of acceptance and  joy had been planted in me, and I
> began to look at Europe, America, and other countries in Asia as also
> my home. I realized that my home is the Earth. Whenever I felt
> homesick for Vietnam, I went outside into a backyard or a park, and
> found a place to practice  breathing, walking, and smiling  among  the
> trees.

> But some cities had very few trees, even then. I can imagine someday
> soon a city with no trees in it at all. Imagine a city that has only
> one tree left. People there are mentally disturbed, because they are
> so alienated from nature. Then one doctor in the city sees why people
> are getting sick, and he offers each person who comes to him this
> prescription: \"You are sick because you are cut off from Mother
> Nature. Every morning, take a bus, go to the tree in the center of the
> city, and hug it for fifteen minutes. Look at the beautiful green tree
> and smell its fragrant bark.\"

> After three months  of practicing  this, the patient will feel much
> better. But because many people suffer from the same malady and the
> doctor  always gives the same prescription, after a short time, the
> line of people waiting their tum to embrace the tree gets to be very
> long, more than a mile, and people begin to get impatient. Fifteen
> minutes is now too long for each person to hug the tree, so the city
> council legislates a five-minute maximum. Then  they have to shorten
> it to one minute, and then only a few seconds. Finally, there is no
> remedy at all for the sickness.

> If we are not mindful,  we might  be in that situation soon. We have
> to remember that our body is not limited to what lies within  the
> boundary of our skin. Our  body is much more immense.  We know that
>  if our  heart  stops beating, the flow of our life will stop, but we
> do not take the time to notice the many things outside of our bodies
> that are equally essential for our survival. If the ozone layer around
> our Earth were to disappear for even an instant, we would die. If the
> sun were to stop shining, the flow of our life would stop. The sun is
> our second heart, our heart outside of our body. It gives all life on
> Earth the warmth necessary for existence. Plants live thanks to the
> sun. Their leaves absorb the sun\'s energy, along with carbon dioxide
> from the air, to produce food for the tree, the flower, the plankton.
> And thanks to plants, we and other animals can live. All of us-people,
> animals,  plants, and minerals-\"consume\" the sun, directly and
> indirectly. We cannot begin to describe all the effects of the sun,
> that great heart outside of our body.

> When we look at green vegetables, we should know that it is the sun
> that is green and not just the vegetables. The green color in the
> leaves of the vegetables is due to the presence  of the sun. Without
> the sun,  no living being could  survive. Without sun, water, air, and
> soil,  there would be no vegetables. The vegetables are the coming-to
> gether of many conditions near and far.

> There is no phenomenon in the universe that does not intimately
> concern us, from a pebble resting at the bottom of the ocean, to the
> movement of a galaxy millions of light years away. Walt Whitman said,
> \"I believe a blade of grass is no less than  the  journey-work of the
> stars\...\" These words are not philosophy. They come from the depths
> of his soul. He also said, \"I am large, I contain multitudes.\"

> This  might be called a meditation on \"interbeing endlessly
> interwoven.\" All phenomena are interdependent. When we think of a
> speck of dust, a flower, or a human being, our thinking cannot break
> loose from the idea of unity, of one, of calculation. We see a line
> drawn between one and many, one and not one. But if we truly realize
> the interdependent nature of the dust, the flower, and the human
> being, we see that unity cannot  exist without  diversity. Unity and
> diversity interpenetrate each other freely. Unity is diversity, and
> diversity is unity. This is the principle of interbeing.

> If you are a mountain climber or someone who enjoys

> the countryside or the forest, you know that forests are our lungs
> outside of our bodies. Yet we have been acting in a way that has
> allowed millions of square miles of land to be deforested, and we have
> also destroyed the air, the rivers, and parts of the ozone layer. We
> are imprisoned in our small selves, thinking only of some comfortable
> conditions for this small self, while we destroy our large self. If we
> want to change the situation, we must begin by being our true selves.
> To be our true selves means we have to [be ]{.italic}the forest, the
> river, and the ozone layer. If we visualize our selves as the forest,
> we will experience the hopes and fears of the trees. If we don\'t do
> this, the forests will die, and we will lose our chance for peace.
> When we understand  that we inter-are with the trees, we will know
> that it is up to us to make an effort to keep the trees alive. In the
> last twenty years, our automobiles and factories have created acid
> rain that has destroyed so many trees. Because we inter-are with the
> trees, we know that if they do not live, we too will disappear very
> soon.

> We humans think we are smart,  but an orchid, for ex ample, knows how
> to produce noble, symmetrical flowers, and a snail knows how to make a
> beautiful, well-proportioned shell. Compared with their knowledge,
> ours is not worth much at all. We should bow deeply before the orchid
> and the snail and join our palms reverently before the monarch
>  butterfly and the magnolia tree. The  feeling of respect for all
> species will help us recognize the noblest nature in ourselves.

> An oak tree is an oak tree. That  is all an oak tree needs to do. If
> an oak tree is less than an oak tree, we will all be in trouble. In
> our former  lives, we were rocks, clouds, and trees. We have also been
> an oak tree. This is not just Buddhist; it is scientific. We humans
> are a young species. We were plants, we were trees, and now we have
> become humans. We have to remember  our past existences and be humble.
> We can learn a lot from an oak tree.

> All life is impermanent. We are all children of the Earth, and, at
> some time, she will take us back to herself again. We are continually
> arising from Mother Earth, being nurtured  by her, and then returning
> to her. Like us, plants are born, live for a period of time, and then
> return to the Earth. When  they decompose, they fertilize our gardens.
> Living vegetables and decomposing vegetables are part of the same
> reality. Without one, the other cannot be. After six months, compost
> becomes fresh vegetables again. Plants  and the Earth  rely on each
> other.  Whether the Earth  is fresh, beautiful, and green, or arid and
> parched depends on the plants.

> It also depends on us. Our way of walking on the Earth has a great
> influence on animals and plants. We have killed so many animals and
> plants and destroyed their environments. Many are now extinct. In
> turn, our environment is now harming us. We are like sleepwalkers, not
> knowing what we are doing or where we are heading. Whether we can wake
> up or not depends on whether we can walk mindfully on our Mother
> Earth. The future of all life, including our own, depends on our
> mindful steps.

> Birds\' songs express joy, beauty, and purity, and evoke in us
> vitality and love. So many beings in the universe love us
> unconditionally. The trees, the water, and the air don\'t ask anything
> of us; they just love us. Even though we need this kind of love, we
> continue to destroy them. By destroying the animals, the air, and the
> trees, we are destroying ourselves. We must learn to practice
> unconditional love for all beings so that the animals, the air, the
> trees, and the minerals can continue to be themselves.

> Our ecology should be a deep ecology-not only deep, but universal.
> There is pollution  in our consciousness. Television, films, and
> newspapers are forms of pollution for us and our children. They sow
> seeds of violence and anxiety in us and pollute our consciousness,
> just as we destroy our environment by farming with chemicals,
> clear-cutting the trees, and polluting the water. We need to protect
> the ecology of the Earth and the ecology of the mind, or this kind of
> violence and recklessness will spill over into even more areas of
> life.

> Our Earth, our green beautiful Earth is in danger, and all of us know
> it. Yet we act as if our daily lives have nothing to do with the
> situation of the world. If the Earth were your body, you would be able
> to feel many areas where she is suffering. Many people are aware of
> the world\'s suffering, and their hearts are filled with compassion.
> They know what needs to be done, and they engage in political, social,
> and environmental work to try to change things. But after a period of
> intense involvement, they become discouraged, because they lack the
> strength needed to sustain a life of action. Real strength  is not in
> power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace.

> If we change our daily lives-the way we think, speak, and act-we
> change the world. The  best way to take care of the environment is to
> take care of the environmentalist. Many Buddhist teachings help us
> understand our inter connectedness with our Mother,  the Earth.  One
> of the deepest is the [Diamond Sutra, ]{.italic}which is written in
> the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and his senior disciple,
> Subhuti. It begins  with  this  question  by Subhuti: \"If daughters
> and sons of good families wish to give rise to the highest, most
> fulfilled, awakened mind, what should they rely on and what should
> they do to master their thinking?\" This is the same as asking, \"If I
> want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and
> principles should I use?\"

> The  Buddha answers, \"We have to do our best to help every living
> being cross the ocean of suffering. But after all beings have arrived
> at the shore of liberation, no being at all has been carried to the
> other shore. If you are still caught up in the idea of a self, a
> person, a living being, or a life span, you are not an authentic
> bodhisattva.\" Self, person, living being, and life span are four
> notions that pre vent us from seeing reality.

> Life is one. We do not need to slice it into pieces and call this or
> that piece a \"self.\" What we call a self is made only of non-self
> elements. When  we look at a flower, for example, we may think that it
> is different from \"non-flower\" things. But when we look more deeply,
> we see that everything in the cosmos is in that flower. Without  all
> of the non-flower elements-sunshine, clouds, earth, minerals, heat,
> rivers, and consciousness-a flower cannot be. That is why the Buddha
> teaches that the self does not exist. We have to discard all
> distinctions between self and non-self. How can anyone work to protect
> the environment without this insight?

> The second notion that prevents us from seeing reality is the notion
> of a person, a human being. We usually discriminate between humans and
> non-humans, thinking that we are more important than other species.
> But since we humans are made of non-human elements, to protect our
> selves we have to protect all of the non-human  elements. There is no
> other way. If you think, \"God created man in His own image and He
> created other  things for man to use,\" you are already making the
> discrimination that man is more  important than  other  things.  When
>  we see that humans have no self, we see that to take care of the
> environment (the non-human elements) is to take care of humanity. The
> best way to take good care of men and women so that they can be truly
> healthy and happy is to take care of the environment.

> I know ecologists who are not happy in their families. They work hard
> to improve the environment, partly to escape family life. If someone
> is not happy within himself, how can he help the environment? That is
> why the Buddha teaches that to protect the non-human elements is to
> protect humans, and to protect humans is to protect non-human
> elements.

> The third notion we have to break through is the notion of a living
> being. We think that we living beings are different from inanimate
> objects, but according to the principle of interbeing, living beings
> are comprised of non-living being elements. When  we look into
>  ourselves,  we see minerals and all  other non-living-being elements.
> Why discriminate against what we call inanimate? To protect living
> beings, we must protect the stones, the soil, and the oceans. Before
> the atomic bomb was dropped  on Hiroshima, there  were many beautiful
> stone  benches in the parks. As the Japanese were rebuilding their
> city, they dis covered that these stones were dead, so they carried
> them away and buried them. Then  they brought in live stones. Do not
> think these things are not alive. Atoms are always moving. Electrons
> move at nearly the speed of light. Ac cording to the teaching of
> Buddhism,  these atoms and stones are consciousness itself. That is
> why discrimination by living beings against non-living beings should
> be dis carded.

> The  last notion is that of a life span. We think that we have been
> alive since a certain point in time and that prior to that moment, our
> life did not exist. This distinction between life and non-life is not
> correct. Life is made of death, and death  is made of life. We have to
> accept  death;  it makes life possible. The cells in our body are
> dying every day, but we never think to organize funerals for them. The
> death of one cell allows for the birth of another. Life and death are
> two aspects of the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so
> that others may live. This deep meditation brings forth non-fear,
> non-anger, and non-despair, the strengths we need for our work. With
> non-fear, even when we see that a problem is huge, we will not burn
> out. We will know how to make small, steady steps. If those who work
> to protect the environment  contemplate  these four notions, they will
> know how to be and how to act.

> In another Buddhist text, the [Avatamsaka (\'\'Adorning the]{.italic}
> [Buddha with Flowers\'? Sutra, ]{.italic}the Buddha further elaborates
> his insights concerning our \"interpenetration\" with our environment.
> Please meditate with me on the \"Ten Penetrations\":

> The first is, \"All worlds penetrate a single pore. A single pore
> penetrates all worlds.\" Look deeply at a flower. It may be tiny, but
> the sun, the clouds, and everything else in the cosmos penetrates it.
> Nuclear physicists say very much the same thing: one electron is made
> by all electrons; one electron is in all electrons.

> The second penetration  is, \"All living beings penetrate one body.
> One body penetrates  all living beings.\" When you kill a living
> being, you kill yourself and everyone else as well.

> The third is, \"Infinite time penetrates one second. One second
> penetrates infinite time.\" A [ksana ]{.italic}is the shortest period
> of time, actually much shorter than a second.

> The fourth penetration is, \"All Buddhist teachings penetrate one
> teaching.  One teaching penetrates all Buddhist teachings.\" As a
> young monk, I had the opportunity to learn that Buddhism is made of
> non-Buddhist elements. So, whenever I study Christianity or Judaism, I
> find the Buddhist elements in them, and vice versa. I always respect
> non-Buddhist teachings. All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching,
>  and one teaching  penetrates all Buddhist teachings. We are free.

> The fifth penetration is, \"Innumerable spheres enter one sphere. One
> sphere enters innumerable spheres.\" A sphere is a geographical
>  space. Innumerable spheres  penetrate into one particular area, and
> one particular area enters into innumerable spheres. It means that
> when you destroy one area, you destroy every area. When you save one
> area, you save all areas. A student asked me, \"Thay,  there  are so
> many urgent problems, what should I do?\" I said, \"Take one thing and
> do it very deeply and carefully, and you will be doing everything at
> the same time.\"

> The sixth penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate one organ. One
> organ penetrates all sense organs\"-eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and
> mind. To take care of one means[ ]{.calibre4}to take care of many. To
> take care of your eyes means to take care of the eyes of innumerable
> living beings.

> The seventh penetration is, \"All sense organs penetrate non-sense
>  organs. Non-sense  organs penetrate  all sense organs.\"  Not only do
> non-sense organs penetrate  sense organs, they also penetrate
> non-sense organs. There  is no discrimination. Sense organs are made
> of non-sense-organ elements. That is why they penetrate  non-sense
>  organs. This helps us remember the  teaching of the  [Diamond
> Sutra.]{.italic}

> The eighth penetration  is, \"One perception  penetrates all
> perceptions. All perceptions penetrate one perception.\" If your
> perception is not accurate, it will influence all other perceptions
>  in yourself and others. Suppose a bus driver has an incorrect
>  perception. We know what may happen. One perception penetrates all
> perceptions.

> The  ninth penetration  is, \"Every sound penetrates one sound. One
> sound penetrates every sound.\" This is a very deep teaching. If we
> understand  one sound or one word, we can understand all.

> The  tenth penetration is, \"All times penetrate one time. One time
> penetrates all times-past, present, and future. In one second, you can
> find the past, present, and future.\" In the past, you can see the
> present and the future. In the present, you can find the past and
> future. In the future, you can find the past and present. They
> \"inter-contain\" each other.  Space contains  time, time contains
>  space. In the teaching of interpenetration, one determines the other,
> the other determines this one. When we realize our nature of
> interbeing, we will stop blaming and killing, because we know that we
> inter-are.

> Interpenetration is an important teaching,  but it still suggests that
> things outside of one another penetrate into each other. Interbeing is
> a step forward. We are already inside, so we don\'t have to enter. In
> contemporary nuclear physics, people talk about implicit order and
> explicit order. In the explicit order, things exist outside of each
> otherthe table outside of the flower, the sunshine outside of the
> cypress tree. In the implicit  order, we see that  they are inside
> each other-the sunshine  inside the cypress tree. Interbeing is the
> implicit order. To practice mindfulness and to look deeply into the
> nature of things is to discover the true nature of interbeing. There
> we find peace and develop the strength to be in touch with everything.
> With this understanding, we can easily sustain the work of loving and
> caring for the Earth and for each other for a long time.

> new ways of life, and new forms of religious belief should be
> introduced in the spirit of respecting and protecting our cultural

> People of our age suffer and feel alienated because they have cut off
> all contact with their cultural roots. As Vietnamese Buddhists we call
> for a return to the source in order to rediscover a feeling of
> confidence in the value of our traditional culture, to foster that
> value, and to enrich it. An individual is not a separate, independent

> herself for peace on May 16, 1967]{.italic}

> [ ]{.calibre4}

 

> In a deep forest in the highlands stood an ancient  tree. No one knew
> how many thousands of years it had lived. Its trunk was so large that
> the arm spans of eighteen  people could not embrace it; great roots
> pushed up through  the ground  and spread to a radius of fifty meters.
> The  earth beneath the tree\'s shadow was unusually cool. Its bark was
> as hard as rock; if you pressed a fingernail against it, pain ran
> through  your finger. Its branches  held tens of thou sands of nests,
> sheltering  hundreds of thousands of birds, both large and small.

> In the morning, when the sun rose, the first rays of light were like a
> conductor\'s baton, initiating a mighty symphony, the voices of
> thousands of birds, a symphony  as majestic  as the sun dawning
>  behind  the summit  of the mountain. All the creatures of the
> mountain and forest arose, either on two feet or four, slowly, in
> wonder.

> In the great tree there was one hole large as a grapefruit from Bien
> Hoa and twelve meters from the ground. In the hole lay a small brown
> egg. No one could say if a bird had brought  the beautiful egg to the
> hole. Some thought  the egg had not come from a living bird but had
> been forged by the sacred air of the forest and the life energy of the
> great tree.

> Thirty years passed; the egg remained  intact. Some nights, birds
> would be startled from their sleep by a cloud hovering over the hole
> and a brilliant light shining there, illuminating an entire  corner
>  of the forest.  Finally, one night,  under a full moon, the egg
> opened  and a strange bird was born. The bird was very little; it gave
> a small chirp in the cold night. The moon was very bright; the stars
> were very bright. The  tiny bird cried throughout the night. Its cry
> was neither tragic nor bold; it was a cry of surprise and strangeness.
> It cried until the sun appeared. The first rays of light opened the
> symphony; thousands of birds\' voices broke forth. From that moment,
> the little bird cried no more.

> It  grew  quickly. The  nuts  and  grains  mother birds brought to the
> hole were always plenty. Soon the hole in the tree became too small,
> and the bird had to find another place, much larger, in which to live.
> It now knew how to fly; it looked for its own food and gathered sticks
> of straw to cover the floor of its new nest. Strangely, although the
> egg had been brown, the bird was as white as snow. When it flew, its
> wingspan was vast, and it moved slowly and very quietly. Often it flew
> to faraway places where white waterfalls tumbled  day and night like
> the majestic  breath  of earth and sky.

> Sometimes the  bird did not  return  for several  days. When  it
> returned, it lay in its nest all day and night, thoughtfully and
> quietly. Its two eyes were very bright; they never lost the look of
> surprise they had from the beginning.

> Now, in the ancient forest of Dai Lao, a hermit\'s small hut stood on
> the slope of a hill. There a monk had lived for almost [fifty
> ]{.calibre3}years. The bird often flew across Dai Lao forest; from
> time to time it saw the monk walking slowly down the path to the
> spring,  holding a water  jug in his hand. One day, smoke gently
> lingered over the roof of the humble hut and an atmosphere of warmth
> surrounded the hill. The bird saw two monks together on the path
> leading from the spring to the hut, speaking as they walked. That
> night the bird remained in Dai Lao forest. Concealed in the branches
> of a tree, the bird watched the light of the fire flickering inside
> the hut, where the two monks conversed through the night.

> The  bird flew high, high over the ancient  forest. For several days
> it flew back and forth in the sky without landing. Below stood the
> great tree in the ancient forest; below, the creatures of the mountain
> and forest were concealed by grass, bushes, and trees. Since the day
> the bird listened to the exchange between the two monks, its
> bewilderment grew. Where have I come from and where will I go? How
> many thousands of years will the great tree stand?

> The  bird had heard the two monks speak about Time.

> What is Time? Why has Time brought us here, and why will it take us
> away? The  nut that a bird eats has its own delicious nature. How can
> I find out the nature of Time? The  bird wanted to pick up a small
> piece of Time and lie quietly with it in its nest for several days to
> examine its nature. Even if it took months or years to examine, the
> bird was willing.

> The  bird flew high, high over the ancient forest. It was like a round
> balloon drifting in nothingness. The bird felt[ ]{.calibre4}its nature
> was as empty as a balloon\'s. The emptiness of its nature was the
> ground of its existence, but it was also the cause of the bird\'s
> suffering. \"Time, if I could find you, certainly I could find
> myself,\" thought the bird.

> After several days and nights, the bird came to rest quietly in its
> nest. It had brought  back a tiny piece of earth from the Dai Lao
> forest. Deep in thought, it picked up the piece of earth to examine
> it. The  monk from the Dai Lao forest had said to his friend, \"Time
> is stilled in Eternity. There Love and Beloved are One. Each blade of
> grass, each piece of earth, each leaf, is one with that love.\"

> The bird was still unable to find Time. The small token of earth from
> the Dai Lao forest revealed nothing. Perhaps the monk had lied to his
> friend. Time  lies in Love, but where is Love? The bird remembered the
> splashing water falls  endlessly  tumbling in  the  Northwest Forest.
> It remembered the days it listened to the sound of the waterfalls from
> morning to evening. The  bird had imagined itself tumbling like a
> waterfall.  It  played with the  light shining  on the water, with the
> waterfall it caressed the pebbles and rocks in the streams. In those
> moments, the bird felt that it was a waterfall itself, that the sound
> of endless falling water came from it.

> One noon, flying across the Dai Lao Forest, the bird did

> not see the hut. The whole forest had burned; only a pile of ashes
> remained  where the monk\'s hut had been. In a panic, the bird flew
> around searching. The  monk was no longer in the forest. \"Where had
> he gone? Corpses of animals. Corpses of birds. Had the fire consumed
> the monk? The  bird was bewildered. Time,  what are you? Why do you
> bring us here and why will you take us away? The monk said, \"Time is
> stilled in Eternity.\" If that is so, perhaps Love has returned the
> monk to Itself.

> Suddenly the bird felt anxious. It flew swiftly back to the ancient
> forest. Anguished cries of many birds. Explosions. The  ancient
>  forest, far away, was burning.  Faster, faster still, the bird flew.
> The fire licked the sky. The fire spread near  the  great  tree.
>  Hundreds of  thousands of  birds shrieked in fright.

> The fire approached the great tree. The bird fanned the fire with its
> wings, hoping to put it out, but the fire burned more fiercely. The
> bird sped to the spring, dipped its wings in the water, and rushed
> back to shake the water over the forest. The drops sizzled. It was not
> enough, not enough. The  bird\'s entire body soaked in water was not
> enough to extinguish the fire.

> Cries of hundreds of thousands of birds. Screams  of young birds
> without feathers to fly. The fire began to burn the great tree. Why
> was there  no rain? Why didn\'t  the downpour that fell endlessly in
> the Northwest Forest flow like a waterfall? The bird let forth a
> piercing cry. The cry was tragic and passionate and was suddenly
> transformed into the rushing sound of a waterfall. All at once, the
> bird felt the fullness of its existence. Loneliness and emptiness
> vanished as an illusion. The image of the monk. The image of the sun
> behind the mountain peak. The image of rushing water falling endlessly
> through a thousand lifetimes. The cry of the bird was now the full
> sound of the waterfall. Without anxiety, the bird plunged into the
> forest fire like a majestic waterfall.

> The  next morning was calm. The  marvelous rays of the sun shone, but
> there was no symphony, no voices of tens of thousands of birds.
> Portions of the forest were completely burned. The great tree still
> stood, but more than half of its branches and leaves were charred.
> Corpses of large birds, corpses of small birds. The morning forest was
> silent.

> The  birds still alive called one another, their voices be wildered.
> They did not know by what grace the clear sky had suddenly poured
> forth  rain, extinguishing  the forest fire the afternoon before. They
>  remembered  seeing the bird shaking water from its two wings. They
> knew it was the white bird from the great tree. They flew everywhere
> throughout the forest seeking the corpse of the white bird, but they
> did not find it.

> Perhaps  the bird had flown away to live in a different forest.
> Perhaps  the bird had been killed by the fire. The great  tree, its
> body covered  with wounds, did not say a word. The birds cocked their
> heads to the sky and began to build new nests in the wounded  body of
> the great  tree. Does the great tree miss the child to which sacred
> mountain air and the life energy  of four  thousand  years had given
> birth?  Bird, where  have you gone? Listen  to the monk: I believe
> Time  has returned  the bird to the Love that is the source of all
> things.[ ]{.calibre4}
