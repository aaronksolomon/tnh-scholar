A verse about death, which is really about life. A transmutation of death; the emptying of the veins of death, the letting in of light and air to those fearful spaces. How does one cope with death, when death strikes, repeatedly, senselessly, destroying the young, the noble, the brave, the self giving? &nbsp;Grief &nbsp;of course, &nbsp;a period &nbsp;of silence, &nbsp;space &nbsp;for mourning. Then afterward, a reassertion, acceptance. And finally, if one is lucky, endowed, perceptive, brave with the bravery of an artist and poet, he creates something that faces the cruelty, the horror, and he brings to that welter of blood, vengeance, cruelty, and deceit, a "sea change."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">It is one of the classic and very nearly crushing ironies of the long war in Vietnam; that we have been the recipient, time and again, of gifts of the spirit, gifts of art, profound understanding, hope communicated,&nbsp; a definition of our selves that exceeds by far our expectation of ourselves. We have heard time and again, from the "enemy," a stubborn distinction between ourselves as a people, and our leadership. Our people have been endowed (by presumption of the same "enemy") with compassion, political acuity, generosity, and goodness of spirit. We were a people saddled for a time with an unfortunate and cruel leadership, which persisted in bloodletting despite the best instinct of the majority. Thus went the reading of our character by our "enemy."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Such definitions have a mysterious power of creating what they signify, in a sense at least analogous to the sacramental. One thinks of such "opinions" so stubbornly held, so patiently reiterated over so long a period of violence, across such unexampled savagery, perpetuated &nbsp;by a whole succession of American leaders-one thinks of this, and is simultaneously appalled, exhilarated, &nbsp;and given hope. Is it possible that out of a persecuted, defamed, all but destroyed people should arise the Suffering Servant of our own oracles; possible that salvation for the heinous, blood-ridden West should once again come from the East-and this, not in times of social normalcy, but across the curtain of blood that we wove and suspended between that people and ourselves, upon which they were stretched and racked, day after day, the people to whom Pascal surely had reference, those "crucified until the end of time"?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In a universal catastrophe, it is surely presumptuous &nbsp;to single out one element, one tradition, as having "suffered more" than others. Who can measure such things? They stop the heart in its tracks. At the same time, the religious resistance in the U.S. at the time of the Vietnam &nbsp;War could not help but take into special account, with a special gratitude, the Vietnamese Buddhist movement. Spiritually speaking, we were closest to them. We drew most fully on their tradition-such a stubborn, unwavering, gentle, persistent, resilient strength! It seems to me far from stretching a point (more likely simply making a point) to see in this Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, and his people, a literal living out of the words of Paul the apostle, writing&nbsp; to his community, "... fatiguing labors more abundant, imprisonments &nbsp;more frequent, lashings innumerable, many threats of death &nbsp;... forty &nbsp;lashes less one ... three &nbsp;times scourged, once I was stoned, &nbsp;three times I suffered ship wreck; a night and a day I was adrift on the high seas; in frequent &nbsp;journey on foot, in perils from floods, in perils from robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, &nbsp;in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder ness, in perils on the sea, in perils from false brethren, &nbsp;in fatigue and hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, in fastings, often in cold and nakedness.... And apart from these things, there is my daily pressing anxiety, my solicitude for all our communities!"</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This monk, this suffering servant, who is also a poet, an activist, a teacher, and scholar, suffered a personal loss of the most appalling nature. Young Buddhists were studying at the School of Youth for Social Service, which Nhat Hanh had founded in Saigon early in the '60s. There the students were imbued with the spirit of nonviolent service. On leaving the school, they were to go in groups to help the peasants of the South in whatever way possible-building homes, sowing or harvesting crops, resettling refugees, simple, concrete &nbsp;projects (we would even say, strikingly evangelical ones). But such a school, in such a time, be came a mortal threat to some of those for whom weapons were the indispensable means of survival or liberation. A period of terrorism &nbsp;was quickly launched. Students &nbsp;were killed and maimed in a series of bombings. Finally, one night a horrendous crime unfolded. Five of the students were seized in their dormitories, led to the riverbank nearby and shot. One survived, the others died immediately. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The episode was not widely reported in the world. It was merely another bloody stereotyped incident of war, a spurt of gunfire in the night, a cry, blood quickly shed, quickly erased. &nbsp;But not &nbsp;forgotten by a monk who was also the friend of the slain. And so after a time, after grief and loss had had their time, came this gift, this meditation of Nhat Hanh, peaceful and serious, theologically profound, hopeful, light, airy of spirit, a paschal death and victory, a pas sage by water from time to timelessness. Written, one may rightfully presume, &nbsp;by one whose soul already &nbsp;is com pounded &nbsp;of these qualities, &nbsp;since he conveys them with such skill. Indeed, to him the dead are the quick, and violence is by no means the master, by no means speaks the last word, or stops the mouth of the victim, or indeed finally rules, whatever his boast, his bloodstained &nbsp;and inflated pretentious.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The ironies implicit in the play are enormous and far of reach. We Americans cross the great waters with our techniques of death, supersonic instruments &nbsp;of appetite, great eyes and ears and maws, a deranged and decapitated sensory apparatus, to smell out and destroy the least lurking evidence of life, health, hope, tradition, faith, family, to tear out the very taproot of existence, to plow up and sow with salt that culture, thousands of years old, which has unfailingly nurtured &nbsp;a people. "Let it come down! Let it all come down!" is the manic whine of the Machine.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">And lo, coming &nbsp;across &nbsp;those same waters (which &nbsp;we name consciousness, Styx, death, or primordial creation) comes another sort of craft, peopled with spirits, listening, bantering, remembering, laughing. Their wounds &nbsp;are healed, their memories lucid. They &nbsp;recall without rancor the method and moment of their death. If there is some thing new about them, it is a quality at once elusive, feisty, a way of standing within death, fronting it, mocking it gently; perhaps best of all, forgiving.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">These&nbsp; spirits are as they were before death. And this is the genius of Thich &nbsp;Nhat Hanh. His dead have the verisimilitude of the living. They are young, they push shadows back instead &nbsp;of joining them. They &nbsp;push the dark back, they create &nbsp;space, they speak up. Very different indeed from the dimwit ghosts of Virgil's underworld; &nbsp;more like the robustness, &nbsp;the crudity, of Dante's &nbsp;people-those &nbsp;in hell, chiefly.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">And yet with a difference, which continues to escape my mind. It has something to do with a work of authentic Buddhist art, by a monk, about his people. A quality of inwardness, almost of austerity; a patience that escapes our monitors and timepieces; a serenity, caricatured cruelly in the West as stoicism, before death. Something of the twice born, the resurrected, something one sees more and more rarely in the West; now and again in the faces of the old, in a few children, in the cruel ecstasy of street &nbsp;violence; a light within, struck and then out.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Only &nbsp;here it is a steady flame. It lights &nbsp;those &nbsp;bodies, making lamps of them, as they cross the waters in our direction. They &nbsp;come toward us, and their speech is all of forgiveness, of hope, and joy. Indeed, the play seemed to me a simple act of forgiveness and reconciliation. Are you saying to us, Nhat Hanh, &nbsp;that the Vietnamese &nbsp;dead will come back to us who murdered &nbsp;them? will come, not as ministers of vengeance, but sacramental presences, angels, spirits of new creation? &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I hope so, with all my heart.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">And I thank you, Nhat Hanh, monk, medium, necromancer, artist. For your grief, for your long travail, your exile, for the deaf and dumb and uncaring world, for the crucifixion and death of your people. Forgive us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">And because the monk Thomas &nbsp;Merton &nbsp;said it to you, and your play says it to me, I dare to repeat: Alleluia! We shall see his face!</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-32"></div>

All five were volunteer &nbsp;workers in the School of Youth for Social Service, a nonviolent organization that sought only to heal the wounds of war and reconstruct &nbsp;the villages. Their names were Tuan, Tho, &nbsp;Hy, Lanh, and Dinh. Tuan was a Buddhist novice.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Four died immediately. The fifth, Dinh, survived, but his clothes were soaked with blood and he lost consciousness. The strangers thought all five were dead, so they left.&nbsp; Silence on the river. There &nbsp;are many stars in the sky, but no moon. A small sampan comes gently to the shore. Mai appears. The sampan is large enough to take the four, only four, because the fifth, Dinh, is still alive, and must stay be hind.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The author has said, "I guarantee that everything in this</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">story is true." What story is he talking about? Is it the story of the five young men shot on the bank of the Saigon River? Everyone knows this is true-why does he have to guarantee it? Or is the author talking about what happened <span class="italic">after </span>the killing, about Mai with the sampan and the five of them rowing with their bare hands?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">True or not, we will never know. But if the author &nbsp;has guaranteed &nbsp;it, then let us believe him. Listen&nbsp; to what he has said: "I remember &nbsp;when I first picked up my pen to write this play. I saw fourteen eyes looking at me, fourteen eyes wide open. I have said that I guarantee the story to be true. But what does it mean to be <span class="italic">true? </span>Who&nbsp; can be my witness?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">"I have said that it is true because I have lived the life of the story. No scientific instrument can verify the existential nature of life in this story.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">"Love enables us to see things that those who are without out love cannot see.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">"Who will be gone and who will stay? Where do we come from and where will we go? Are the other shore and this shore one or two? Is there a river that separates the two sides, a river that no boat can cross? Is such complete separation &nbsp;possible? Please come over to my boat. I will show you that there is a river, but there is no separation. Don't hesitate: I will row the boat myself. You can join me in rowing too, but let us row slowly, and very, very quietly."</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_3">Thich Nhat Hanh</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_3">Paris, December 1967</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-33"></div>

Now that we're both dead, there is no way to find out whether my head was hard or your hand was soft.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: Please, Tho, be quiet. I can see that you are quite bright. But please sit still! It's too difficult to row with you fidgeting like that. We've got hours to go.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">HY: </span>Are we really going to see Sister Lien? </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Yes, Sister Lien and Sister Vui.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: "What are they doing up there, Sister Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Vui is still working for the villagers.

The last time I saw her she was pasting labels on the bottles of the mold they use to grow straw mushrooms.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO <span class="italic">(teasingly): </span>She is probably growing the mushrooms to sell to the people &nbsp;in the hamlet. &nbsp;Vui should &nbsp;wander about and just enjoy herself.

She is grown-up, you know.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: I'm not a little boy. I'm only two years younger than Vui. I worked hard for the villagers too!

Head of the Binh Phuoc work camp! Some head! How you went around &nbsp;winning respect is beyond me.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: I don't &nbsp;care for anybody's respect. When &nbsp;we were alive, I used to act up a bit now and then to win your re spect, &nbsp;but &nbsp;now &nbsp;that &nbsp;I'm &nbsp;dead, &nbsp;why should &nbsp;I &nbsp;bother? Brother Hy, tell me, are you sorry, I mean, are you sorry about being dead?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: What a question! Joy and sorrow are the affair of the living. Come on now, let's row a bit harder, and listen to this:</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">(Hy sings) Listen to me</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">as you would the song of the brook or the song of the bird;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">as you would look on the green weeping cherry,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">the pink roses, the yellow chrysanthe'lllums, &nbsp;the blue bamboo, the white clouds, the bright moon.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">(Faint sounds of little waves slapping against the sides of the boat)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Wherever Hy goes he brings &nbsp;music and &nbsp;poetry along.

Do I have to keep working for the villagers like Vui?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: No, you can do as you please. You can wander around and enjoy yourself. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Great! Then &nbsp;maybe I'll be like Lien. All she does is walk here and there.

If Vui wants to do that, there is work for her to do. The universe of the dead changes according to your wishes. <span class="italic">As </span>I see it, the universe of the living does, too.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TUAN </span><span class="italic">(in a low voice, to himself): </span>The mind is like a painter. It can paint anything it wants.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: There goes Tuan and his Buddhist philosophy! Sister Mai, what <span class="italic">is </span>this world we are in now? Heaven or Hell? <span class="italic">As </span>far as I can see, it's not different from the world of the living.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: It is neither Hell nor Heaven, Tho. And it's not as far away from the world of the living as people generally believe</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: For that matter, the world of the living is not far from Heaven and Hell. Wouldn't you agree, Sister Mai? I feel that if I sing now, the living will hear me.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Well, at last we hear from you, Lanh. You've been so quiet. Yes, you are right. The saying "Yin and Yang are irrevocably separate" is misleading. A lot of the sorrow that plagues the living comes from their belief that the two worlds are unbridgeable. Indeed, you can sing for the living, as I have many times... as Hy just did. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Hy used to be head of the Performing Arts Committee. Tell me, Hy, when we were alive, art was a means for rural redevelopment. We used poetry, painting, music, and theater to help people. How shall we use them now?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Hy: When we were alive, art was with us. Now, art is still with us. Perhaps we are still alive, in some way. While we were living, we were already dying. How could we have life without death, or, for that matter, death without life?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: You're beginning to sound like Brother Tuan. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TuAN <span class="italic">(clears his throat): &nbsp;</span>And just what does that mean? </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: Like a philosopher.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: But, Tho, &nbsp;you sound like a philosopher, too. We all do. We always do when we become aware of something. Now that we are dead, we are much more lucid.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN : This &nbsp;feels like the Saigon River. Is this still our country, our land, our water?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Yes, you only died last night, on the bank of this very river, eight kilometers back. <span class="italic">As </span>soon as it happened, I came here with this &nbsp;boat to get you. Now we are going &nbsp;upstream, toward the frontier.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">(A </span><span class="italic">long silence)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN <span class="italic">(smiling faintly): </span>It's funny, I feel as if we died a long time ago. When I saw you coming, I felt as if I were waking up from a long, deep sleep. Now, I'm really quite awake.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: I wasn't surprised at all when I saw you, Sister Mai. It seemed the most natural thing in the world for you to be there. If you hadn't come, who would have? </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: It's true, I could never be too busy for all of you.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>If you hadn't come, we would still be sitting on the riverbank, waiting. If we had thought of you and wanted to find you, we wouldn't have known where to look.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: If you had thought of me, you would have seen me coming. <span class="italic">As </span>I said a while ago, all things happen here ac cording to our wishes.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: &nbsp;</span>It's strange. I don't feel any sorrow, pain, or bitter ness. Sister Mai, I thought we would bear those feelings, even after death. The living always tell stories about people who die unjustified deaths. They &nbsp;talk about the revenge of the dead, and they become deathly afraid. Now I see that the dead are calmer and more lucid than the living. We dead do not think at all about vengeance. We just feel compassion for the living, even for those who killed us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">THO: </span>If I were alive, I would go to the home of the man who killed me to ask him why he dragged &nbsp;me to the riverbank in the dead of the night and shot me. But I don't feel any grudge against him, none at all.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">HY: &nbsp;</span>Perhaps we dead are more forgiving because we no longer have to bear the heavy burden of our bodies, and their desires and angers. Desire and anger need a home, and now that we no longer have our bodies...</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: But Hy, how can you say that we no longer have our bodies? How could I see you if you didn't have a body? Our bodies are no longer heavy, no longer a burden, that's all. See how small and delicate this boat is, and yet it carries all five of us with ease. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: You're right! We really <span class="italic">are </span>light. The boat carries us and even moves quickly. Tell me, Sister Mai, were you there when they shot us?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: &nbsp;No. &nbsp;But I had a strong sense that &nbsp;something was wrong, so I came with the boat to get you. When I arrived, the four of you were still sitting &nbsp;on the riverbank. &nbsp;Hy's clothes were soaking wet, and he was shaking a little.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: When &nbsp;they shot me, I fell into the river. Because my arms were tied behind me, I could only use my feet to <span class="calibre4">try </span>to rise to the surface, but they kept shooting &nbsp;until I sank completely.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Oh,Hy...</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Please don't feel sorry for me, Sister Mai. Save it for those still alive. I only had to go through a few seconds, a short minute of pain, that's all. But those close to us, who are still alive, they are the ones who suffer. Even those who killed us. They don't know what they did.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Tell me, Hy, how did it happen?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: It was about midnight. Tuan, Lanh, and I were asleep at the Health &nbsp;Aid Post when a group &nbsp;of armed &nbsp;men arrived. They tied our arms behind us and set the Post on fire. The flames made it look as bright as day. Then they took us to the lake near the Tinh Vo Gymnasium and told us to wait. A moment later, two more men arrived with Dinh and Tho. Their arms were also tied behind their backs. Then they took all five of us to the riverbank. We were next to the bamboo grove, supposedly waiting for a boat. Again and again they asked if we were part of the Youth for Social Service, to be absolutely sure. Then, suddenly, they shot us. We four died, but Dinh was only wounded. They thought he was dead too, so they left.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TuAN: </span>There were eleven of them. Some were very young, sixteen or seventeen. The &nbsp;oldest must have been under thirty. Some of them wore black clothes, some wore uni forms. One had a raincoat &nbsp;and another &nbsp;a poncho. Some wore military caps and bullet belts. I know who they were.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: I know who they were, too. You don't have to say.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: I had the feeling &nbsp;they were not experienced at the business of killing. They &nbsp;had to kill us, but I could feel their reluctance.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: They obviously had orders from someone. The leader of the group, the one who shot me in the head twice, looked as though &nbsp;he had to convince himself to pull the trigger. He just didn't have it in him to do it easily. When they arrived at the house of the village medical chief, they immediately tied us together &nbsp;so we couldn't &nbsp;run. On the way to the river, we had to jump over two ditches about a meter&nbsp; wide, and at the second one, Dinh &nbsp;fell and they helped him up. I asked if they would cut us loose from each other so we could walk more easily, and they did. While we were walking, they talked to us in a very friendly way.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>The men who abducted the three of us behaved the same way. They were very gentle. They let us stop and rest a couple of times. I really thought it wouldn't be too bad. When &nbsp;Tho &nbsp;crawled under &nbsp;barbed wire and cut himself, one man touched &nbsp;his forehead and asked about &nbsp;it, as a brother would. Another even patted me on the shoulder.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: And then they killed us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: What a pity! Men are such pitiful creatures.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Sister Mai, you know I didn't say that with any blame. My eyes are now open. I see clearly now. I only hope that men discover a better way to be.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: If anyone is tired, you can change your rowing hand. Just change seats with the person next to you. Tho, &nbsp;why don't you move over there and let Brother Tuan sit here. Good, let's go on. But take it easy, there's no hurry. The stars are so bright. You know, Hy, the eyes of the living have a difficult time seeing the whole of life.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Isn't there a way to change that?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl <span class="italic">(speaking very slowly): </span>Man has progressed some, but so slowly. That &nbsp;is why, with our present consciousness, time in the living world goes so fast. Tell me, Brothers, before they shot you, did they say anything in particular?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: They &nbsp;asked us if we were part of the School &nbsp;of Youth for Social Service. Then they walked a little ways away and whispered &nbsp;to each other. &nbsp;After&nbsp; that &nbsp;they approached us again and asked the same question, and then they consulted each other again in whispers. They repeat ed this a few more times, then they asked us, "Do you have anything to say?" When &nbsp;I heard &nbsp;that, &nbsp;chills ran up my spine. Tho said we had nothing to say, and the leader touched his forehead and said, very quickly, "I have to kill you." Then &nbsp;he put his gun to Tho's temple, and fired two shots. The rest of us were shot right after. Hy fell into the river, and was shot until he sank.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Poor &nbsp;Hy. Brother Van will be shattered when he hears about this. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TuAN: Yes. All those close to us will feel the loss. There &nbsp;is one consolation. <span class="italic">(He smiles) </span>The &nbsp;living forget quickly. In just a few months, the pain in their hearts will be soothed. Other worries and sorrows will help them forget. &nbsp;How could they go on living and working if they did not forget?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Still, I feel sorry for them. Some will record their love and pain on bricks and stones, or on paper with ink, to help themselves remember. But the only important image of the departed is the one that remains in the heart. As far as I am concerned, I pray that all those who were dear to me would forget me quickly so that they will not have to suffer any longer.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: Tho! What are you doing now?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Oh, no! He has regressed to his childhood. Watch out, dear Tho! You are tipping the boat!</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Now that I can become a child or a young adult as I wish, I do not long for my childhood any more.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: Come &nbsp;back, Tho, to the Tho of twenty-one. I never met the Tho of eight. Please come back at once. THO: All right, here I am. Brother Tuan, you are still quite</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">bound by appearance. Don't you remember, it says in the scriptures, "It is not possible to recognize the Buddha by his physical appearance?" Since you were studying to be a fully ordained monk, you should be able to see me in any form. Why must I be only the Tho of twenty-one?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: Okay! But don't preach to me from the <span class="italic">Diamond Sutra. </span>Tho, do you really think that I cannot &nbsp;transform myself into a little child just as well as you? I am only afraid that if I did, you would be on your knees, begging your old Tuan to come back again.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO <span class="italic">(laughing): &nbsp;</span>You're the one who was studying to be a monk, not I! It is only natural that I would <span class="italic">not </span>recognize you in the form of an eight year old.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: Oh please, Tho, stop teasing Brother Tuan and sit still. Tuan, do you remember the exact moment you were shot?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TuAN: </span>When I saw they had shot Tho,&nbsp; I recited the name of Amitabha&nbsp; Buddha, and right away I was riddled with bullets. I died quickly and felt no pain at all. What &nbsp;happened to Dinh?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: He &nbsp;is still &nbsp;alive, Tuan. &nbsp;One &nbsp;bullet &nbsp;went &nbsp;through Dinh's arm and lung and punctured &nbsp;his pancreas. I bent down to look at him. The strangers had already gone, and Dinh was still conscious. He coughed over and over, and each time blood spurted &nbsp;out. &nbsp;His shirt &nbsp;was completely soaked &nbsp;in blood, &nbsp;but he will be rescued &nbsp;in time, &nbsp;don't worry.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO <span class="italic">(thoughtfully): &nbsp;</span>When he is well again, he will tell our friends what happened. I wonder if he will remember anything to tell.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>Maybe it would even be better if he doesn't remember anything. We died for tolerance and love, not for more hate and destruction.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: I have faith in Brother &nbsp;Van and our friends. I have</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">faith in all our brothers and sisters still living. They have refused and will always refuse to choose the road of violence. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">(A long silence, followed by flarebombs exploding on the river</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">bank, illuminating the water)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Hy: They fire flarebombs all night, don't they!</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: If they could see the dead, they would know we are rowing leisurely on the river. And they would hear &nbsp;the sound of the water lapping against the side of our boat in the dead of night.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Hy: They don't see us only because they don't think of us. If our beloved Brother Duc were there on the riverbank, he would see us and wave. Sister Mai, why does our coun try go on bleeding? When will this fire burn itself &nbsp;out?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Be calm, Brother. Our country will be destroyed and our people will suffer even more than they already have. The &nbsp;cycle must be completed. Life and death are in the course of things. In the end there will be peace.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">(Gun sounds from all sides)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Some shooting! You know, Sister Mai, my mother can't sleep when she hears the guns.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Is she living by herself? Isn't there a child to stay with her?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: She is bringing &nbsp;up a small niece and they sleep together. But I am her only child.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: I heard that your father died a violent death also. Who killed him, Tho?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: When I was a child, I knew vaguely that he worked for the revolution. But let's not talk about this now. Mai, you said a while ago that Vui is working for the villagers. I still don't understand. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: You will. Don't expect to understand everything in a single night. I will show you Vui's village. She has many children in her school. Her village also has water buffalo, oxen, rivers, and many trees-banana, lemon, and manda nn.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Then &nbsp;I too will go on working for the villagers. I remember &nbsp;the lemon trees. But Sister Mai, you still have not told us <span class="italic">your </span>story. What &nbsp;have you done since you left us?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Yes, you sacrificed yourself for the cause of peace such a long time ago. How many years has it been since then, Sister Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Years! It's only been a few months, hasn't it?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Everyone has his own notion of time. For me, it isn't a matter of months or years. It was lifetimes ago, generations ago.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Tell me, Sister Mai, was the fire very hot?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: What &nbsp;a question! I only remember &nbsp;that I was calm. And my wish was fulfilled. Before the moment arrived, I prayed that I would be able to sit still in the fire. I sat very still.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: When we heard the news, we cried like babies. We thought that you left us because you didn't care about us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Do not say that, &nbsp;Brother. There is no choice &nbsp;that does not involve suffering.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Oh, we were jealous of you. Remember that we were still living. We were jealous of your spirit and your act, that is all. I certainly understand it better now. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: Then where did you go, Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl <span class="italic">(silent and thoughtful a long while): </span>I stood on the bal cony looking down at my own body enveloped in flames. Yes, I think I even smiled, though my eyes were filled with tears. All the people standing around were weeping, and I wept with them. But when my father arrived, I didn't cry. That was the most difficult moment. Nothing can be more painful than seeing &nbsp;those dear to you suffer because of what you have done. I left long letters to my parents, ask ing them to understand. But, as you know, letters &nbsp;don't mean very much.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">HY: </span>Then what happened, Sister Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: My father fainted, regained consciousness, and then fainted again. Fortunately, an Army captain arrived and wanted to examine and confiscate my charred body. My father was so angry that he shook all over, and somehow, his anger subdued his pain.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: Three cheers for the captain!</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Since then I have had all the time in the world, and I have been very peaceful. My heart went out to each one of you. Many times I came to aid and protect you. What happened tonight is different. It is destiny.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">HY: </span>What have you done since then?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: I have gone to many places. Up the mountain, down to the sea. Don't you see? I'm still wearing white grapefruit blossoms in my hair. Even though my eyes have seen our ruined gardens and rice fields, my heart has been set free. I know that peace will come. The wheel is turning in that direction. I've gone through entire areas where the forests have been burned down, charred and black, where the bombs have crushed &nbsp;the earth and bulldozed &nbsp;the fields, making craters everywhere. And I've seen crowds of refugees carrying their meager possessions on their backs-babies, cooking pots, a few clothes-their steps undecided, their eyes bewildered.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>Can the dead do anything to help the living, Sister? MAl <span class="italic">(laughs): </span>I died a long time ago, but I know I am not</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">really dead. The voice and figure in front of you are only</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">my voice and body in relation to yours. I am still present in the world of the living, and there I go on with my work.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Present in the world of the living? How can you be dead and, at the same time, present in the world of the living?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: It is simple. I think Brother Tuan will explain it to you.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TuAN: </span>Go ahead, Sister Mai, you explain.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: If you set fire to a piece of charcoal, it burns red and becomes heat. When the fire dies, the charcoal is reduced to ash. Heat is the afterlife of the charcoal. From then on, the heat begins an uninterrupted &nbsp;process of influences, either in terms of energy or physical properties. And that process of transformation, like a chain reaction, takes place either directly or indirectly in relation to other processes of transformation.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TuAN: </span>We call it "correlated reactions."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAI: Yes, "correlated &nbsp;reactions." Nothing &nbsp;can be lost; yet at the same time, nothing that remains static can keep its nature intact. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: It's the same as when Tho &nbsp;became the eight year old he once was. Even though &nbsp;we did not recognize him, he was exactly what he was.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Death is change, a sudden evolution, that's all. If Tho had died when he was eight, &nbsp;there would not have been any Tho of twenty-one to die just a while ago and to be sit ting here now. Actually, though, &nbsp;the eight year old Tho had to die, to give way to the twenty-one year old Tho. But the death of the eight-year-old Tho was not sudden. It was a progressive change, a process of growing.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: One could also say it was a second-by-second evolution, while our own deaths tonight are an evolution of an entire period, an entire cycle.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: That is more &nbsp;to the &nbsp;point &nbsp;than &nbsp;my explanation, Brother Tuan. That is it, Hy. In order to grow, Tho had to receive support from many other forms of existence-air for his lungs, food for his body, education &nbsp;for his mind, love for his heart. In Tho, &nbsp;there are innumerable physical and mental beings-his father and mother, myself, and that girl with ruddy cheeks who will cry this morning over his departure. She should &nbsp;be sleeping peacefully now in the world of the living.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: I see, Sister Mai! You are saying that I am present in her now, too, and in all who love me in the world of the living. That is why I am still there, and still able to provoke this chain reaction.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: That's right. &nbsp;But you are not only present &nbsp;within them, you are present outside them as well. All you have said and done has already begun its journey. You are pre sent everywhere. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Then &nbsp;what we see in front of us now is not all of Tho?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: How can it be when already the Tho of twenty-one is no longer the Tho of eight? The Tho in front of us is only the Tho of the narrow world of our perceptions. He is merely our perception of Tho.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH <span class="italic">(raising one finger): </span>Sister Mai, first let me say something, then you tell me whether I am wrong or right. We are rowing up the Saigon River and telling ourselves that we are going to pay a visit to Lien and Vui. Actually, we are only going to see the Lien and Vui in the world of our own perceptions because their real existence is far greater. We only need to look back to see them everywhere.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: You are right. What we are doing is searching for the Lien and Vui of our feelings and habits. That &nbsp;is why we have to struggle upstream to reach the frontier. In truth, they are even more &nbsp;present &nbsp;in the world of the &nbsp;living. Their &nbsp;presence there is clearer and more substantial than in this world.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Still, I would like to visit the village where Vui is working to see if she is doing better than last year. And I would like to see the lemon trees of my homeland again.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: But no one says you cannot. You will see Vui. You can even become a work camp head here, you know.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: And Lien, where is she now?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: She lives with Vui, leisurely and peacefully, smiling almost all the time. They are practically inseparable. The last time I saw her, she had the whole collection of the <span class="italic">Maha &nbsp;Prajñaparamita &nbsp;Sutra &nbsp;</span>in her hand. You know, she is reading the entire collection.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: If I read the <span class="italic">Prajña Sutra &nbsp;</span>now, I think I would understand it much more easily. There is such peace and calm within my heart.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: When we see Lien, we have to ask her to explain the Prajña Sutra to us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: When I was alive, not a day passed when I did not recite the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra. </span>I thought I understood it. But it was only when the man with the poncho pointed a gun at my head that I really saw what the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra </span>was all about.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Tell us, Brother Tuan, what did you see?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: It's hard to say, Lanh. It's not something to be un derstood but to be <span class="italic">seen. </span>We can easily explain what we un derstand, but not what we see or perceive. It came all of a sudden, like lightning.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH <span class="italic">(begging): </span>But try, Brother Tuan, what did you see? TUAN: Well, when that man with the poncho brought his</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">gun up to my head, I realized immediately, without being aware of it consciously, that he was not going to shoot <span class="italic">me. </span>He was going to shoot something &nbsp;else, but not me. How could&nbsp; he shoot &nbsp;me without knowing &nbsp;who I was? Since then, I have been wondering how someone can blow the brains out of another without knowing him.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: You are funny, Brother Tuan! He asked us over and over again to make sure that we really were the Youth for Social Service, before he killed us. He shot you because he <span class="italic">knew </span>who you were. You were a member of the Youth for Social Service. They &nbsp;wanted to kill the Youth for Social Service. Therefore &nbsp;they shot you.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>Why are you smiling, Sister Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Tho is speaking in terms of logic, and the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra </span>is exactly the tool we need to shatter &nbsp;that kind of reasoning.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">TuAN: </span>I agree with you, Sister Mai. "Youth for Social Service" is just a label that they pasted on the objects of their hatred or fear, an object that exists only in their perception. It has nothing to do with us as persons. They shot only at the object of their fear and hatred, &nbsp;but because they had pasted the label of this object on us, they ended up shooting us, and we died by mistake. They killed us because they truly did not know who we were.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Brother Tuan, are you speaking about wrong perceptions? Hatred &nbsp;and fear blind us. We no longer see each other. We see only the faces of monsters, and that gives us the courage to destroy each other.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: The&nbsp; war that is raging in our homeland is caused by exactly this blindness. Those who are shooting at this very moment &nbsp;do not know who they are fighting. All are victims. And some are ready to profit from the mutual destruction.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>That is certainly true of those who killed us. In a fleeting moment, I think they saw that we were just human beings, not monsters. But, when the moment arrived, they</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">had to shoot, to obey orders. It must be the cruel, irrevocable order imposed on man's destiny. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THo: Oh, Lanh, you talk as if there were such a thing as an abstract &nbsp;order. That order came from their superiors, &nbsp;who else?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: You do not &nbsp;understand, Tho. The ones who killed you were only obeying &nbsp;the orders &nbsp;of their superiors. And those superiors &nbsp;were also victims. Yet, those who shot you did show their human qualities. They hesitated, &nbsp;not wanting to kill you, fighting against &nbsp;themselves. They had to carry out their orders &nbsp;because they were crushed &nbsp;between the hammer and the anvil, the orders &nbsp;and their &nbsp;families, their &nbsp;jobs, even their lives. Their consciences &nbsp;and perceptions had been greatly obscured.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: One man even exclaimed, "God, you are all so young!" It was not &nbsp;just an expression of pity for us, but also a pro test against his own fate.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Men kill because, on the one hand, they do not know their &nbsp;real enemy, and on the other &nbsp;hand, &nbsp;they are pushed into a position &nbsp;where they must kill. Let me tell you what happened &nbsp;to our Brother &nbsp;Duc last year. He was waiting for a civilian plane at a small isolated airport &nbsp;in the highlands, along with a young American army officer who was waiting for a caribou plane to fly him on a search-and-destroy operation. There was no one else besides &nbsp;the two of them. The young American struck up a conversation &nbsp;with Brother Duc, who immediately saw that the man knew nothing about Vietnamese history or culture or the&nbsp; truth of the conflict in which he was playing a part. He knew only one thing: the Vietcong were his enemy. His duty, as he put it, was to destroy the Vietcong in order &nbsp;to save the Vietnamese and the free world. Brother &nbsp;Duc felt so sad. He asked the GI, "Are you afraid of Vietcong?" With &nbsp;that question the soldier leaped to his feet. Duc saw the alarm and suspi cion in his eyes, fear that Duc himself might be a VC. The GI had been told again and again that the VC were very cunning, and wherever he went, he imagined that the VC were present. So he asked rapidly, putting his hands on his gun, "Are you a VC?" Brother Duc thought &nbsp;the question was funny, but he dared not smile. He knew that if he said, in a joking spirit, "Yes," the soldier would shoot him. So he answered, "No," and explained that he was only a professor of religion waiting to catch a plane back to Saigon. Do you know what our Brother Duc said after he had told us about this incident? &nbsp;He said that if he had been killed then, it would not have been because the American soldier wanted to kill him. The&nbsp; soldier only wanted to kill Vietcong. He could hate the VC only because he did not really know what the VC were. He imagined that they were wild, cruel monsters that had to be hunted down. In his country the people are fed so much of this that they keep letting their government send men over here to kill and be killed. So, men kill unjustly and in turn are killed unjustly, and it is their own countrymen &nbsp;who kill them. They &nbsp;are the ones responsible for the massacre of our people, but they think they have nothing to do with it because it is not they who hold the guns and pull the triggers. Who is really killing us? It is fear, hatred, and prejudice.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: The world of the living is shrouded in fog. All I feel now is compassion for the destiny of mankind. It is like walking in a moonless, starless night.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: Excuse me, but may I change the subject? You know, one of the reasons I am taking you to see Sister Lien is that I want you to see her paintings. I believe that she has really achieved something. In her earthly life she loved art very much, but now she has realized it. I am sure she draws inspiration from the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">HY: Vui, too, used to love art when she was alive. I suppose they are in accord now. I love painting &nbsp;myself. Do you think I will understand Sister &nbsp;Lien's work? Inspiration drawn from the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra, </span>that's awesome!</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl: What wouldn't you be able to understand, Hy? Just a while ago we discussed the <span class="italic">Prajñaparamita </span>itself! We each paint our own lives.&nbsp; If your work is broad and free your life will be broad and free, also. That&nbsp; is all. We create our own worlds with our visions, conceptions, and thoughts. We might create a constricted world of suffering and sorrow, or one that is immense &nbsp;and free, a truly &nbsp;beautiful place. The essential ingredient is a spirit of openness, tolerance, and freedom.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">HY: </span>Now I understand what Brother Tuan meant when he said, "The mind is like a painter."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">MAl <span class="italic">(laughs): </span>Yes. Why don't you all begin here and now to paint your own lives. Every artist is capable, through &nbsp;his art, of reaching the supreme objective of life itself.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Tho: Then my picture, Sister Mai, will probably look like that of Vui. My world must contain a lemon tree! I once threatened Brother Duc &nbsp;that &nbsp;if the Pure &nbsp;Land &nbsp;has no lemon trees I will refuse to enter! But that's not all. My world will also have coconut trees, moats where the water is clear in the morning, &nbsp;thatch-roofed schools where at noontime &nbsp;the children's singing reaches my ears: "Lam Son Mountains! Lam Son Mountains! Banners flapping in the wind!" </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH: </span>Tho, do be quiet!I didn't realize that the dead could be homesick! When &nbsp;little Thanh of Binh Phuoc Hamlet hears that his teacher has been killed, he will cry until he has no tears left. Yes, our Pure Land must contain those little boys, and friendly meetings in the village where the first event of the program is always, "Our &nbsp;headman has a few words to say to you." There &nbsp;must also be those wharfs down by the river where we bathe, where we can swim over to the other side and snatch a few ears of com to roast on an open fire and eat together. It is such a small world, isn't it, Sister Mai?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">MAI &nbsp;</span><span class="italic">(smiles tolerantly): </span>No, Lanh, it is not a small world. The &nbsp;strokes of your painting are those of love. Not only scenes of mountains or clouds or immense skies are breath taking. Lonely pines standing on snowy cliffs can also be free and bold. The world of the bodhisattvas also has lakes and ponds, low hills, curved bridges, and red earthen paths.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">LANH &nbsp;</span><span class="italic">(mysteriously): </span>And highways.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">MAl: </span>Yes, and highways. Because of love, you draw lemon trees, &nbsp;fig trees, &nbsp;bamboo &nbsp;groves, and river wharfs. The longer the war lasts, the more hatred it creates, and love is being crushed underfoot. We see those dear to us unjustly destroyed and it is hard to keep our hearts peaceful so that love can survive. Using hatred to fight hatred is the surest way to create even more hatred. Those who create love are fewer and fewer, while those who create hate are more and more. And we are changed by it all. Simple, honest, close to-the-earth people, even after the war is over, will go on bearing the deep wounds inflicted by all this hatred. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Isn't that the biggest concern? It must be better to be destroyed in a split second and then recreated, than to destroy all faith and love.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">TUAN: Yes, Lanh, that is our basic concern. I, myself, was born in 1945, the year of the revolution. The last of our family's three boys. As we grew up, all we saw was war and hatred. My hometown, Ben Tre, was where the energy and fervor of the revolution were in constant movement, much like the swift, deep water of the Tien&nbsp; Giang River on its way to the sea. Fortunately, my family realized early on the necessity of love and encouraged me to follow my inclina tion for a monk's life. I went to the Buddhist Institutes of Giac Sanh, Tra Vinh, and later An Quang. Then I took up social studies and fieldwork. When &nbsp;I worked hard, it was not because I had any illusion about my ability to change the situation. That &nbsp;would have been like trying to extinguish a forest fire with a cup of water. But I did have faith then, and I still have faith now, that our work was of value because it sowed seeds of tolerance &nbsp;and love in people's hearts.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">LANH: Let us hope that our earthly &nbsp;lives, as well as our deaths, have sown the seeds of tolerance and love. Sister Mai's death, for instance, did not provoke any hatred. On the contrary, it awakened in many people the ability to un derstand and sacrifice, even people far away.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">MAl: </span>We are approaching the &nbsp;source &nbsp;of the &nbsp;river, my brothers.

Is Vui's village near the frontier? </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre4">MAI: </span>Yes. In twenty kilometers, we will leave the boat for the jungle. The &nbsp;current will be so strong &nbsp;that it will be impossible for us to continue &nbsp;to row upstream.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">(Monkeys' cries echo through &nbsp;the forest)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">THO: Dawn is almost here, friends.

<blockquote class="calibre_">-<span class="calibre3">Chapter One</span> -</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3">Love in Action</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2">The essence of nonviolence is love. Out of love and the willingness to act selflessly, strategies, &nbsp;tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise naturally. Nonviolence is not a dogma; it is a process. Other struggles may be fueled by greed, hatred, fear, or ignorance, but a non violent one cannot &nbsp;use such blind sources of energy, for they will destroy those involved and also the struggle itself. Nonviolent action, born of the awareness of suffering and nurtured by love, is the most effective way to confront adversity.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The Buddhist struggle for peace in Vietnam in the 1960s and '70s arose from the great suffering inflicted on our nation by international forces. Blood and fire ravaged the countryside, &nbsp;and people everywhere were uprooted. The Vietnam War was, first and foremost, an ideological struggle. To ensure our people's survival, we had to overcome both communist and anticommunist fanaticism and maintain the strictest &nbsp;neutrality. Buddhists tried their best to speak for all the people and not take sides, but we were condemned as "pro-communist &nbsp;neutralists." Both warring parties claimed to speak for what the people really wanted, but the North &nbsp;Vietnamese spoke for the communist &nbsp;bloc and the South &nbsp;Vietnamese spoke for the capitalist &nbsp;bloc. The Buddhists only wanted to create a vehicle for the people to be heard-and the people only wanted peace, not a "victory" by either side.&nbsp; During our struggle, many scenes of love arose spontaneously-a monk sitting calmly before an advancing tank; women and children raising &nbsp;their &nbsp;bare hands against barbed &nbsp;wire; students confronting military &nbsp;police who looked like monsters wearing huge masks and holding bayonets; young women running &nbsp;through &nbsp;clouds of tear gas with babies in their arms; hunger strikes held silently and patiently; monks and nuns burning themselves to death to try to be heard above the raging noise of the war. And all of these efforts bore some fruit.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Any nonviolent action requires a thorough understanding of the situation and of the psychology of the people. In Vietnam, we inherited many ideas from the Buddhist tradition and we learned from our mistakes as we went along. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Buddhist monks joined the struggle for independence from the French, &nbsp;and they won the support &nbsp;of their countrymen. When the Vietnam War broke out, they still had that support, as well as the knowledge gained earlier to go beyond passive resistance and undertake &nbsp;positive efforts to over come the war and the oppression. In 1966, when the people of Hue &nbsp;and Danang learned &nbsp;that Field Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky was about to bring tanks and troops from Saigon to suppress the movement for peace, the people of those cities brought &nbsp;their family altars-the most sacred objects in their homes-onto the streets, relying on their culture and tradition &nbsp;to oppose the forces of destruction. Some people were critical, saying they used religion for political &nbsp;purposes, &nbsp;but I do not agree. They &nbsp;were usingtheir most potent spiritual force to directly confront &nbsp;the violence. This was not a political act; it was an act of love.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Fasting, the method used most by Mahatma Gandhi to help India in its struggle for independence, &nbsp;was also used in Vietnam. Sometimes, &nbsp;thousands of people fasted, and other times, a single person fasted. We fasted as prayer to purify our hearts, consolidate our will, and arouse awareness and compassion in others. When Thich Tri Quang fasted for 100 days, those who passed the Duy Tan Clinic were jarred into awareness, and compassion was born in them. As a result, they felt compelled &nbsp;to meet, talk, and plan, thereby escalating the struggle. Thich Tri Quang had not <span class="italic">planned </span>to fast. He <span class="italic">had </span>to fast.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We also used literature and the arts as "weapons" to challenge the oppression. Works by antiwar writers, composers, poets, and artists, although illegal, were widely circulated. Antiwar songs were sung in streets and classrooms, and antiwar literature became the largest category of books sold in Vietnam, even infiltrating army units. <span class="italic">Look Back at Your Homeland, Only Death Allows You to Speak Out, </span>and <span class="italic">Lotus in a Sea of Fire </span>sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Our literature was considered &nbsp;dangerous &nbsp;by both sides. One book of poems, <span class="italic">Let Us Pray so the White Dove Will Be with Us, </span>was submitted to the Ministry of Information, and only two of the sixty poems in it were approved. A group of students published it anyway, and within a week, all copies were sold. In Hue, a policeman saw a copy in a bookstore and warned the owner, "Hide &nbsp;this and only bring it out when someone asks for it." Sister Cao Ngoc Phuong was arrested &nbsp;in Hue for transporting antiwar books, and, before I left the country, I was also arrested and imprisoned for a few days in Bao Loc for "antiwar" activities, although I was charged only with the crime of listening &nbsp;to Hanoi Radio.&nbsp; Folk poetry was used as means of education. This lullaby was sung throughout the country:</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">My hand is holding a bowl of ginger and salt. Ginger is hot, salt is strong.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">They embrace each other.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">North and South share the same sorrow.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">We love each other,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">why have we abandoned our love?</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This "Prayer for Peace" was printed by the tens of thousands and chanted during religious services throughout Vietnam, and its effects were widely felt:</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Homage to all Buddhas in the ten directions. Please have compassion for our suffering. Our land has been at war for two decades. Divided, it is a land of tears,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">and blood and bones of young and old.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Mothers weep till their tears are dry, while their sons on distant &nbsp;fields decay. Its beauty now torn apart,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">only blood and tears now flow.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Brother killing brothers for promises from outside.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2">During the superpower confrontation in Vietnam, while thousands and thousands of peasants &nbsp;and children lost their lives, our land was unmercifully ravaged. Yet we were unable to stop the fighting; we were not able to make ourselves heard or understood. We had little access to the international news media. People thought we Buddhists were trying to seize power, but we had no interest in power. We only wanted to stop the slaughter. The voice of the Viet namese people-8O percent &nbsp;Buddhists-was lost in the melee of shooting and bombs. But we realized &nbsp;that the means and the end are one, and we never employed any kind of action &nbsp;that &nbsp;betrayed &nbsp;our commitment to nonviolence.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In 1963, Venerable Thich Quang Duc went to the cross</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">roads of Phan &nbsp;Dinh &nbsp;Phung, &nbsp;sat in the &nbsp;lotus &nbsp;position, poured gasoline on himself, and transformed himself into a torch. His disciple read his last words to the press. Madame Nhu described it as a "barbecue." By burning himself, Thich &nbsp;Quang Duc awakened the world to the suffering of the war and the persecution of the Buddhists. When someone stands up to violence in such a courageous way, a force for change is released. Every action for peace requires someone to exhibit the courage to challenge the violence and inspire love. Love and sacrifice always set up a chain reaction of love and sacrifice. Like the crucifixion of Jesus, Thich Quang Duc's act expressed the unconditional willingness to suffer for the awakening of others. Accepting the most extreme kind of pain, he lit a fire in the hearts of people around the world. Self-burning was not a technique or program of action. When anyone wished to burn himself or herself, the Buddhist leaders always tried to prevent it. But many monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen did sacrifice themselves for peace in this way, including my disciple Nhat Chi Mai, who declared that she wanted to be "a torch in the dark night."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Nhat Chi Mai was one of the first six people ordained into the Tiep Hien Order. In 1966, she placed a statue of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, and a statue of the Virgin Mary in front of her, and burned herself alive at the Tu Nghiem Temple, a nunnery. She left behind letters to the Presidents&nbsp; of North &nbsp;and South Vietnam, imploring &nbsp;them to stop the fighting. &nbsp;She wrote one letter to me: "Thay, don't worry too much. We will have peace soon." Nhat Chi Mai moved the hearts of millions of her countrymen, evoking the force of love.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I know that the self-immolation of monks and nuns was difficult for Westerners to understand. The Western press called it suicide, but it was not really suicide. It was not even a protest. What the monks wrote in the letters they left behind was intended only to move the hearts of the oppressors and call the world's attention &nbsp;to the suffering of our people. To make a statement while enduring such unspeakable pain is to communicate with tremendous determination, &nbsp;courage, and sincerity. During the ordination ceremony in some Buddhist traditions, the ordainee burns one or more very small spots on his body with <span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">moxa </span></span>incense as he takes the 2<span class="italic">50 </span>vows of a monk, promising to live a life devoted to helping living beings. If he were to say this while sitting comfortably in an armchair, it would not be the same. When uttered &nbsp;while kneeling before the community of elders and experiencing &nbsp;this kind of pain, his words express the full seriousness of his heart and mind.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;Vietnamese&nbsp; &nbsp;monks, &nbsp;nuns, &nbsp;and &nbsp;laypeople &nbsp;who burned themselves were saying with all their strength and determination that they were willing to endure the greatest of suffering in order to protect their people. But why did they have to burn themselves to death? The difference between burning oneself with incense and burning oneself to death is only a matter of degree. What is important is not to die, but to express courage, determination, and sincerity-not to destroy, &nbsp;but to create. &nbsp;Suicide &nbsp;is an act of self-destruction based on the inability to cope with life's difficulties. In Buddhism, self-destruction is one of the most serious transgressions &nbsp;of the precepts. Those &nbsp;who burned themselves had lost neither courage nor hope, nor did they desire nonexistence. They were extremely courageous and aspired for something good in the future. They sacrificed themselves in order to seek help from the people of the world. I believe with all my heart that those who burned themselves did not aim at the death of the oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies were not human beings, but the intolerance, &nbsp;fanaticism, oppression, greed, hatred, and discrimination that &nbsp;lay within the hearts of their fellow men and women.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We did not plan self-immolations or any of the other methods that were used. But confronting the situation and having compassion in our hearts, ways of acting came by themselves. You cannot prefabricate techniques of nonviolent action and put them into a book for people to use. That would be naive. If you are alert and creative, you will know what to do and what not to do. The basic requisite is that you have the essence, the substance of nonviolence and compassion in yourself. Then &nbsp;everything you do will be in the direction of nonviolence. Besides self-immolation, fasting, and the use of art, literature, and culture, many other tactics were employed in Vietnam. Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau, for example, resigned in 1963 and shaved his head to protest the violent policies of the Diem regime, and many professors and students followed suit. There &nbsp;were labor strikes at the harbors and markets, and business owners turned in their licenses. University deans, presidents, and professors resigned, and high school and university students &nbsp;boycotted &nbsp;classes and examinations. Draftees refused to fight. All of these acts were met with atrocious reprisals. The government used unbridled brutality-tear gas, suffocation gas, grenades, prisons, and torture-to obstruct and suppress these nonviolent efforts.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Police agents posed as monks and nuns and infiltrated our movement, damaging our prestige and sowing seeds of fear. They excited extremists and fanatics to overturn and destroy the leadership and members of the movement. No one knows exactly how many Buddhist and non-Buddhist leaders of the nonviolent movement were imprisoned &nbsp;or killed, including professors, students, intellectuals, politicians, workers, and farmers. Even social workers trying to help the peasants were terrorized and murdered. From the School of Youth for Social Service, eight people were kidnapped, six killed, and eleven seriously wounded-all &nbsp;because they refused to take sides in the war. In a memorial service organized for those who were killed, the SYSS students openly affirmed their commitment to nonviolence and neutrality: "Now, in the presence of our dear friends whose bodies are lying here, we solemnly proclaim that we cannot consider you who killed them to be our enemies. Our arms are open wide; we are ready to embrace your ideas and advice to help us continue our nonviolent ways of working for the people of Vietnam."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Despite &nbsp;the &nbsp;results-many years of war followed &nbsp;by years of oppression and human rights abuse-1 cannot say that our struggle was a failure. The conditions for success in terms of a political victory were not present. But the success of a nonviolent struggle can be measured only in terms of the love and nonviolence attained, not whether a political victory was achieved. In our struggle in Vietnam, we did our best to remain true to our principles. We never lost sight that the essence of our struggle was love itself, and that was a real contribution to humanity.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-37"></div>

In the past four days, five Vietnamese have immolated themselves, some of them leaving behind messages explaining that their actions were in protest against U.S. policy in South Vietnam. During my short visit to your country, &nbsp;I have repeatedly been asked why the Vietnamese people seem to have become so strongly anti-American.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I wish, first&nbsp; of all, to assure you that &nbsp;I am not &nbsp;anti American. Indeed, it is precisely because I do have a great respect and admiration for America that I have undertaken this long voyage to your country, &nbsp;a voyage that entails great personal risk for me upon my return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this risk willingly because I have faith that if the American public can begin to understand some thing of what the Vietnamese &nbsp;people feel about what is happening in our country, much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery being endured by both our peoples might be eliminated.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The demonstrations, self-immolations, and protests that we are witnessing in Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frustrations that the Vietnamese people feel at being so effectively excluded from participation in the determination of their country's future. Eighty years of French domination over Vietnam were ended by a long and bloody struggle waged and won by the Vietnamese people against overwhelming odds. During the twelve years since independence, most Vietnamese have remained without a voice in the nation's destiny, and this at a time when the nation is being subjected to a destructive force far surpassing anything ever before seen in our country. If anti-Americanism seems to be emerging &nbsp;as a focus for some of the recent protests, &nbsp;it is because the Vietnamese people recognize that it is really only the awesome U.S. power that enables the Saigon governments to rule without a popular mandate and to follow policies contrary &nbsp;to the aspirations of the Vietnamese &nbsp;people. This &nbsp;is not &nbsp;the independence for which the Vietnamese people fought so valiantly.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The war in Vietnam today pits brother against brother, the Vietcong against the supporters of the Saigon government. Both sides claim to represent the Vietnamese people, but in reality neither &nbsp;side does. The &nbsp;most effective Vietcong propaganda says that the Saigon governments are mere puppets of the U.S., corrupt lackeys of the imperialists.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Every escalation &nbsp;of the war, every new contingent of U.S. troops confirms these charges and wins new recruits to the Vietcong, &nbsp;for the overwhelming &nbsp;majority &nbsp;of the Vietnamese people now thirst desperately for peace and oppose any further expansion of the war. They see clearly that the present &nbsp;policy of constant &nbsp;escalation only puts peace ever further into the future and merely guarantees an even greater destruction of Vietnamese society. There &nbsp;are now more than 300,000 Americans in my country, most of them knowing and caring little about our customs and practices and many of them involved in destroying Vietnamese people and property.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This &nbsp;creates friction &nbsp;which generously &nbsp;feeds the anti American propaganda, &nbsp;and the fact that the war kills far more innocent &nbsp;peasants than it does Vietcong is a tragic reality of life in the Vietnamese countryside. Those &nbsp;who escape death by bombings must often abandon &nbsp;their destroyed villages and seek shelter &nbsp;in refugee camps where life is even more miserable than it was in the villages. In general, these people do not blame the Vietcong for their plight. It is the men in the planes, who drop death and destruction &nbsp;from the skies, who appear to them to be their enemies. How can they see it otherwise?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The United States chooses to support those elements in</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Vietnam that appear to be most devoted to the U.S.'s wishes for Vietnam's future. But these elements have never been viewed by the Vietnamese people as their spokesmen. Diem was not, nor were Diem's successors. Thus, &nbsp;it has been the U.S.'s antipathy to popular government in South Vietnam, together &nbsp;with its hope for an ultimate&nbsp; military solution, that has not only contradicted the deepest aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but actually undermined the very objective for which we believe Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To us, America's first objective is to have an anticommunist, or at least a non-communist, Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese people's objective is to have peace. They dislike communism, but they dislike war even more, especially after twenty years of fighting and bitterness which has rotted the very fabric of Vietnamese life. Equally important, we now see clearly that continuance of the war is more likely to spread communism in Vietnam than to contain it. The new social class of military officers and <span class="calibre4"><span class="italic">commerfants </span></span>that has been created as a direct result of the U.S. involvement, a class of sycophants who support the war for crass economic reasons, are not the people to whom Washington should listen if it sincerely wishes to hear the voice of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people reject with scorn this corrupt &nbsp;and self-seeking class that cares neither &nbsp;for Vietnam nor for the great ideals of America, but thinks only of its own interests.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The opinion is often expressed that there is no alternative to the present U.S. policy in Vietnam, neither on the political nor the military side. The non-communist alternatives to a military dictatorship &nbsp;are said to be too fragmented&nbsp; to offer a stable alternative, and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal &nbsp;are considered &nbsp;unfeasible &nbsp;because it is feared that the Vietcong will take over the country by terror.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The Vietnamese people recognize both of these dangers, but they also recognize &nbsp;the utter &nbsp;futility &nbsp;of the present course and the catastrophic effects that it is having on our society. Furthermore, we do not agree that there is no alternative to a military dictatorship. The force of Vietnamese nationalism is such an alternative. Indeed, this is the sole force that can prevent the complete disintegration &nbsp;of South Vietnam, and it is the force around which all Vietnamese can unite. But nationalism cannot attain its effective potential in the present Vietnamese political climate, where opposition to the government invites open persecution upon oneself and identification with it discredits one in the eyes of the people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">More &nbsp;than a decade of this atmosphere has served to drive many of the Vietnamese nationalists into the National Liberation Front, and many others of them into an ominous silence. Last year, an effort by a prominent group of nationalists &nbsp;to circulate a mild petition &nbsp;requesting &nbsp;peace negotiations &nbsp;between the South Vietnamese government and the NLF was so brutally attacked by the government that we are not likely to hear from them soon again, de spite their having attained some 5,000 signers in less than three days' time.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Today, the means for nationalist expression rests mainly with the Vietnamese Buddhists, who alone command sufficient popular support &nbsp;to spearhead a protest for popular government. This &nbsp;is not a new role for Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the Vietnamese&nbsp; peasants, Buddhism and nationalism are inseparably entwined. The historic accident that made the popularization of Christianity in Vietnam coincident with France subjugation of Vietnam created this image.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The repression of our faith by the French and by President Diem strengthened it. And today, when the Buddhist attempt &nbsp;to give expression to the long pent-up wishes of the submerged and ignored Vietnamese masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the Vietnamese army, the Vietnamese people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly see whose action reflects our national heritage and whose action betrays this heritage. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Thus, although &nbsp;the Vietnamese &nbsp;people may lose skirmishes because they have no foreign sources of support, the crude victories of the Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their credibility while confirming the Vietcong's propaganda claim that the government cares nothing about the people. The Buddhist efforts are designed not to weaken Vietnam's resistance but to create a genuine will to resist.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Differences do exist among the Buddhists, the Catholics, and the other sects, but they would not be insurmountable if there were a climate in Vietnam that encouraged unity. But there are those who see a unified, popular, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a threat to themselves. Such persons help to sow disunity and then use the disunity which they create as a pretext for retaining power. No, we do not accept the evaluation &nbsp;that there is no alternative to the present type of government.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The second argument offered for continuing the present U.S. policy is that a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal would merely leave Vietnam to the communists. This argument we must also reject. The Vietcong grow stronger &nbsp;because of the mistakes made by Saigon, not because of its communist ideology or its terror. If South Vietnam could achieve a government clearly responsive to the basic aspirations of the Vietnamese people and truly independent, there would no longer be any basis for popular support for the rebels. Indeed, &nbsp;the rebels would have lost their reason to rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to continue, the Vietnamese people would have the will to resist it, for they could identify it as being hostile to Vietnamese nationalism, contrary to the people's longing for peace and reconstruction, and therefore of foreign inspiration.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Since coming to the United States, I have been asked repeatedly to outline concrete proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam. Although &nbsp;I am not a politician &nbsp;and cannot therefore suggest every detail of a satisfactory settlement, the general direction that such a solution must take is quite clear to me and to many of the Vietnamese people. It does not involve the U.S. in any negotiations &nbsp;with Hanoi, Peking, or the NLF. To the Vietnamese people, such talks, if necessary, are the proper province of Vietnamese officials rather than of Washington.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">My solution would be along the following lines:</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">1. A </span><span class="italic">cessation of the bombing, north and south.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">2. Limitation of all military operations by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces to defensive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Vietcong respond in kind.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S. intention to withdraw its forces from Vietnam over a specified period of months, with withdrawal actually beginning to take place as a sign of sin cerity.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">4. A clear statement &nbsp;by the U.S. of its desire to help the Vietnamese &nbsp;people to have a government truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to implement &nbsp;this statement, such as a refusal to support one group over another.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">5. A generous effort to help rebuild, in light of the destruction</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">that has been wreaked upon Vietnam, such aid to be completely free of ideological and political strings and therefore not viewed as an affront to Vietnamese independence.</span>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Such a program, if implemented with sufficient vigor to convince &nbsp;the now understandably skeptical Vietnamese people of its sincerity, offers the best hope for uniting them in a constructive effort and for restoring stability to South Vietnam.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The plan is not perfect, for the question remains of how the U.S. can be sure that the South Vietnamese government and the Vietcong would cooperate in such a venture. Insofar as the South Vietnamese government is concerned, the past statements &nbsp;of Premier &nbsp;Ky have clearly indicated his unwillingness to seek a peaceful end to the war. In fact, it has been the contradiction between the aggressive words of Saigon and the peaceful statements of Washington that has so discredited the so-called U.S. peace offensive of last winter. The &nbsp;withdrawal of the U.S. support &nbsp;for Ky may thus be a necessary precondition for implementation of such a plan.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">It is obviously not possible to predict the response of the Vietcong to such a program, but the installation of a popular government in South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the beginning of an American withdrawal, would so undercut the Vietcong's position that it is likely to have no alternative but to cooperate.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Finally, if some may question why I ask the U.S. to take the first step, it is because the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation in the world. No one can accuse it of cowardice if it chooses to seek peace. To be a genuine leader requires moral strength as well as big guns. America's history suggests that she has the potential&nbsp; to provide the world this leadership.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-38"></div>

<blockquote class="calibre_">-<span class="calibre3">Chapter Three</span> -</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3">Our Green Garden</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">From the </span>New York Review of Books, <span class="italic">June 9, 1966</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre2">I</span>n Vietnam, we take great risks publishing antiwar poems. Buddhists who have protested the war have been arrested and exiled, and are now being killed in Danang. Because of this great risk, the Buddhists who demonstrated this Spring were reluctant to advocate openly an end to the war through negotiations; instead, they called for elections and democracy. We are in an impossible dilemma. If we openly call for peace, we are identified with the communists and the government will try to suppress us. If we criticize the communists, we find ourselves aligned with those Vietnamese who have been propagandists &nbsp;for the Americans for years and whose words against communism are soiled and discredited because they have been paid to say them. To be honorably anticommunist has been to remain silent, and, being silent, we have been labeled as innocent of the dangers of communism. But we are not. We are well aware of the restrictions on Buddhism in the North. We have studied &nbsp;what happened &nbsp;in China. &nbsp;We know there &nbsp;is no place for spirituality in Marxism. We are ready to under take a peaceful political struggle with the communists, if only the destruction of the war can be stopped. We are confident &nbsp;that the South .Vietnamese can protect &nbsp;themselves from communist &nbsp;domination &nbsp;if we are allowed to carry out our political lives in peace.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;tragedy of American policy is that it has made such a peaceful political struggle very difficult. The Americans could have helped in reconstructing the country peacefully if they had cooperated with and strengthened the Buddhists and others who had the respect of the people. Instead, they have tried to divide the Buddhists to prevent them from becoming an organized force, and this has been disastrous. Catholicism came to Vietnam with the French, and the Catholic leaders, backed by the U.S., were objects of suspicion for most of the people. The Buddhist tradition is closely linked with nationalism, and it is unthinkable to the broad mass of people that the Buddhists would betray them to a foreign &nbsp;power. At the same time, Vietnamese Buddhism is syncretic in character-there are Catholic priests who are closer to us on the question of peace than some of the older, more conservative Buddhist priests. (A few months &nbsp;ago, eleven Catholic &nbsp;priests issued a strong statement calling for peace, and they were attacked by the Catholic leaders.)</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Now the U.S. has become too afraid of the communists to allow a peaceful confrontation with them to take place, and when you are afraid, you cannot win. Sending 300,000</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">American troops to Vietnam and bombing the countryside have only caused the communists to grow stronger. American military operations have killed and wounded more innocent peasants than Vietcong, and the Americans are blamed and hated for this. The peasants are not violently antagonistic to the Vietcong. The strong anticommunists are mostly people in the cities who fear the loss of their property, cars, businesses, and homes, and rely on the foreign army to protect them. The American soldiers, moreover, do not understand the Vietnamese. GIs make thousands of small mistakes every day that offend Vietnamese people. And the continual roaring overhead of U.S. planes on their way to drop bombs makes the people sick and angry.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">So it is understandable that the villagers distrust those who are connected with the South Vietnamese government and the Americans. Along with others, I helped organize a Buddhist School of Youth for Social Service, and we have trained thousands of young people to work at community development projects in the villages. We refuse to accept money from the government or the American Military Assistance Group. We go into the villages with nothing but our own robes, and we are warmly welcomed. The &nbsp;peasants we work with tell us that the government officials assigned to "assist" them keep thousands of piasters a month for themselves and do nothing for them. They have come to dislike the Vietcong and fear the Americans, whose bombs continue to fall down on them.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If the U.S. wants to escalate the war, we Vietnamese cannot stop you. Even changes of government will make no difference. The war will go on. Venerable Thich Tri Quang believes we may attain peace indirectly by means of political maneuvering and through elections. He is a man of action, courage, and intelligence, whose life is exemplary. But other Buddhists are trying to create a new Buddhist path emphasizing ways of helping the people who live on the land. I myself doubt that much will be gained by indirect political maneuvering against the government and the Catholics, as long as the U.S. is determined to continue the war. Underlying &nbsp;our struggles with the government &nbsp;in Danang and other cities is the unstated question of whether the war will go on, and this only the U.S. can decide. I believe the most effective thing we can do is advocate peace, however dangerous that may be, by telling the world that we do not accept this war, that the communists are growing stronger every day it continues to be fought, &nbsp;and that a cease-fire &nbsp;must be arranged &nbsp;with the Vietcong as soon as possible. Then we would welcome the help of Americans in the peaceful reconstruction of our country. Only America has the capability of stopping this war, which is destroying not only our lives, but our culture and everything of human value.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;poems that follow are not typical of my own poetry or of Vietnamese poetry generally. The tradition of poetry in Vietnam is very old and complex. It draws on early Chinese poetry, on the French Romantic and symbolist poets of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and, in my own case, on Zen Buddhist writers. Much of my poetry could be called "philosophical," and friends &nbsp;have found &nbsp;it in some ways similar to the work of Tagore; at least, it is extremely difficult to translate into English.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">But these poems are different. They are popular poems</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">in free verse, and when I write them I am trying to speak very simply for the majority of Vietnamese, who are peas ants and cannot speak for themselves. They do not know or care much about words like "communism" or "democracy," but only want the war to end so they can survive. I wrote these poems first for myself; when I read them I can regain the state of intense &nbsp;feeling in which I composed them. They have now been read and heard by many Vietnamese; &nbsp;and they have been denounced by both &nbsp;sides fighting in the war. A few days after they were published last year, government police came to seize them from the bookstores, but by then they had all been sold. They were attacked by the Hanoi radio and the radio of the National Liberation Front. They have been read many times in public along with the peace poems of other &nbsp;Buddhists, and they have been sung with guitar accompaniment at student meetings, much as songs of protest are sung in the United States.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Condemnation</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Listen to this:</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Yesterday six Vietcong came through my village, </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">and because of this, the village was bombed. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Every soul was killed.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">When I returned to the village the next day,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">there was nothing but clouds of dust-</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">the pagoda without &nbsp;roof or altar,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">only the foundations of houses,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">the bamboo thickets burned away.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Here in the presence of the undisturbed stars,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">in the invisible &nbsp;presence of all people still alive on Earth, </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">let me raise my voice to denounce this dreadful war,</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">this murder of brothers </span><span class="italic">by </span><span class="italic">brothers!</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">Whoever is listening, be my witness: </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">I cannot accept this war.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">I never could, I never will.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">I must say this a thousand times before I am killed.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">I am like the bird who dies for the sake of its mate, </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">dripping blood from its broken beak and crying out, "Beware!

<blockquote class="calibre_">-<span class="calibre3">Chapter Four</span>-</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_"><span class="calibre3">Ahimsa: The Path of Harmlessness</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2">The Sanskrit word <span class="italic">ahimsa, </span>usually translated &nbsp;"nonviolence," literally means "non-harming" or "harmlessness." To practice ahimsa, first of all we have to practice it within ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going in the direction &nbsp;of non violence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed in that direction.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even soldiers. Some army generals, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid killing innocent people; this is a kind of nonviolence. To help soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with them. If we divide reality into two camps-the violent and the nonviolent-and stand in one camp while attacking &nbsp;the other, &nbsp;the world will never have peace. We will always blame and condemn those we feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without recognizing &nbsp;the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on ourselves and also work with those we condemn if we want to have a real impact. It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as enemies, even &nbsp;those &nbsp;who act violently. We have &nbsp;to approach &nbsp;them &nbsp;with love in our &nbsp;hearts &nbsp;and do our &nbsp;best to help them move in a direction &nbsp;of nonviolence. If we work for peace out of anger, we will never succeed. Peace is not an end. &nbsp;It can never &nbsp;come &nbsp;about &nbsp;through non-peaceful means. When &nbsp;we protest against a war, we may assume that we are a peaceful &nbsp;person, &nbsp;a representative of peace, &nbsp;but this might &nbsp;not be the case. If we look deeply, we will observe that &nbsp;the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have been living. We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves &nbsp;and others, therefore we are co-responsible: "Because I have been like this, they are like that." A more holistic approach &nbsp;is the way of "interbeing": "This &nbsp;is like this, because that is like that." This &nbsp;is the way of understanding and love. With &nbsp;this insight, we can see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go to a demonstration and say, "This war is unjust, destructive, &nbsp;and not worthy of our great nation." This is far more effective than angrily condemning others. Anger always accelerates the damage.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We know how to write strong &nbsp;letters &nbsp;of protest, &nbsp;but we must also learn &nbsp;to write love letters &nbsp;to our President &nbsp;and Representatives, demonstrating the kind of understanding and using the kind of language &nbsp;they will appreciate. If we don't, our letters may end up in the trash and help no one. To love is to understand. We cannot express love to someone unless we understand him or her. If we do not understand our President&nbsp; or Congressperson, we cannot write him or her a love letter.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">People are happy to read a good letter in which we share our insights &nbsp;and our understanding. When &nbsp;they receive that kind of letter, they feel understood and they will pay attention to your recommendations. You may think that the way to change the world is to elect a new President, but a government is only a reflection of society, which is a reflection of our own consciousness. To create fundamental change, we, the members of society, have to transform ourselves. If we want real peace, we have to demonstrate our love and understanding so that those responsible for making decisions can learn from us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry and frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is capable of understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there is a bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara who has 1,000 arms and 1,000 hands, and has an eye in the palm of each hand. One thousand hands represent action, and the eye in each hand represents understanding. &nbsp;When you understand &nbsp;a situation &nbsp;or a person, any action you do will help and will not cause more suffering. When &nbsp;you have an eye in your hand, you will know how to practice true nonviolence.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Imagine if each of our words also had an eye in it. It is</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">easy to depict a hand with an eye, but how might an artist also put an eye into our words? Before we say something, we have to understand what we are saying and the person to whom our words are directed. With &nbsp;the eye of understanding, we will not say things to make the other person suffer. Blaming and arguing are forms of violence. When we speak, if we suffer greatly, our words may be bitter, and that will not help anyone. We have to learn to calm our selves and become a flower before we speak. This is "the art of loving speech."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Listening is also a deep practice. The &nbsp;bodhisattva Ava lokitesvara has a deep talent for listening. In Chinese, his name means "listening to the cries of the world." We have to listen in a way that we understand the suffering of others. We have to empty ourselves and leave space so we can listen well. If we breathe in and out to refresh and empty ourselves, we will be able to sit still and listen to the person who is suffering. When she is suffering, she needs someone to listen attentively without judging or reacting. If she cannot find someone in her family, she may go to a psychotherapist. Just by listening deeply, we already alleviate a great &nbsp;deal of her pain. This &nbsp;is an important practice &nbsp;of peace. We have to listen in our families and in our communities. We have to listen to everyone, especially those we consider our enemies. When we show our capacity of listening and understanding, the other person will also listen to us, and we will have a chance to tell him of our pain. This is the beginning of healing.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Thinking is at the base of everything. It is important for us to put an eye of awareness into each of our thoughts. Without a correct understanding of a situation or a person, our thoughts can be misleading and create confusion, de spair, anger, or hatred. Our most important task is to de velop correct insight. If we see deeply into the nature of interbeing, that all things "inter-are," we will stop blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with everyone. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">These &nbsp;are the three domains of action-body, speech, and mind. In addition, there is <span class="italic">non-action, </span>which is often more important than action. Without our doing anything, things can sometimes go more smoothly &nbsp;just because of our peaceful presence. In a small boat when a storm comes, if one person remains solid and calm, others will not panic, and the boat is more likely to stay afloat. In many circumstances, non-action can help a lot. A tree merely breathes, waves its leaves and branches, and tries to stay fresh. But if the tree were not there, we could not be here. The &nbsp;tree's non-action is fundamental to our welbeing. If we can learn to live the way a tree does-staying fresh and solid, peaceful and calm-even if we do not do many things, others will benefit from our non-action, our presence. We can also practice non-action &nbsp;in the domain of speech. Words can create understanding and mutual acceptance, or they can cause others to suffer. Sometimes it is best not to say anything. This is a book on nonviolent social action, but we must also discuss nonviolent &nbsp;non-action. If we really want to help the world, the practice of non-action is essential.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Of course, sometimes non-action can be harmful. When someone needs our help and we refuse, she may die. If a monk, for example, sees a woman drowning and does not want to touch her because of his precepts, he will violate the most fundamental principle of life. When we see social injustice, if we practice non-action, we may cause harm. When people need us to say or do something, if we don't, we can kill by our inaction or our silence.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To practice ahimsa, we must first of all learn ways to deal peacefully with ourselves. If we create true harmony within ourselves, we will know how to deal with family, friends, and associates. Techniques &nbsp;are always secondary. Most important is to become ahimsa, so that when a situation &nbsp;presents itself, we will not create &nbsp;more suffering. To practice ahimsa, we need gentleness, loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity directed to our &nbsp;bodies, our&nbsp; feelings, and other &nbsp;people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Real peace must be based on insight and understanding, and &nbsp;for this we must &nbsp;practice deep &nbsp;reflection-looking deeply into each act and each thought &nbsp;of our daily lives.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">With &nbsp;mindfulness-the practice of peace-we can begin by working &nbsp;to transform the wars in ourselves. There are techniques &nbsp;for doing this. Conscious &nbsp;breathing is one. Every time we feel upset, we can stop what we are doing, refrain from saying anything, &nbsp;and breathe in and out several times, aware of each in-breath and each out-breath. If we are still upset, we can go for walking meditation, mindful of each slow step and each breath &nbsp;we take. By cultivating peace within, &nbsp;we bring about &nbsp;peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in ourselves is to minimize the numbers of wars between this and that feeling, or this and that perception, and we can then have real peace with others as well, including &nbsp;the members of our own family.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I am often&nbsp; asked, "What if you are practicing love and</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">patience &nbsp;and someone &nbsp;breaks into your house and tries to kidnap your daughter or kill your husband? &nbsp;What should you do? Should &nbsp;you shoot &nbsp;that person or act in a nonviolent way?" The &nbsp;answer depends &nbsp;on your state of being. If you are prepared, you may react calmly and intelligently, in the most nonviolent &nbsp;way possible. But to be ready to react with intelligence &nbsp;and nonviolence, you have to train yourself in advance. It may take ten years, or longer. If you wait until &nbsp;the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too late. A this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial moment, even if you know that nonviolence &nbsp;is better than violence, if your understanding is only intellectual and not in your whole being, you will not act nonviolently. The fear and anger &nbsp;in you will prevent you from acting in the most nonviolent &nbsp;way.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To prevent war, to prevent the next crisis, we must begin</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">right &nbsp;now. When a war or a crisis has begun, &nbsp;it is already too late. If we and our children practice ahimsa in our daily lives, if we learn how to plant seeds of peace and reconciliation in our own hearts and minds, we will begin to establish real peace and, in that way, we may be able to prevent the next war. If another war does come, we will know that we have done our best. Is ten years enough &nbsp;time to prepare ourselves and our nation to avoid another &nbsp;war? How much time does it take to breathe consciously, to smile, and to be fully present in each moment? &nbsp;Our real enemy is forgetfulness. If we nourish mindfulness every day and water &nbsp;the seeds of peace in ourselves and those around &nbsp;us, we have a good chance to prevent the next war and to defuse the next crisis.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-40"></div>

God Bless the United States &nbsp;of America." &nbsp;I suspect &nbsp;that at the same moment many Moslems were also praying to their God to protect Iraq and the Iraqi soldiers. How could God know which nation to support? Many people pray to God because they want God &nbsp;to fulfill some of their needs. If they want to have a picnic, they may ask God for a clear, sunny day. At the same time, farmers who need more rain might pray for the opposite. If the weather is clear, the picknickers may say, "God is on our side; he answered our prayers." But if it rains, the farmers will say that God heard&nbsp; <span class="italic">their &nbsp;</span>prayers. This is the way we usually pray.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught, <span class="italic">"Blessed are</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God." </span>Those who work for peace must have a peaceful &nbsp;heart. When you have a peaceful heart, you are the child of God. But many who work for peace are not at peace. They still have anger and frustration, and their work is not really peaceful. We cannot say that they belong to the Kingdom of God.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To preserve peace, our hearts must be at peace with the world, with our brothers and our sisters. When we try. To overcome evil with evil, we are not working for peace. If you say, "Saddam Hussein is evil. We have to prevent him from continuing &nbsp;to be evil," and if you then use the same means he has been using, you are exactly like him. Trying to overcome evil with evil is not the way to make peace.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Jesus also said, <span class="italic">"Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ... whosoever shall say, 'Thou fool,’ shalt be in danger of hell fire."</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Jesus did not say that if you are angry with your brother, you will be put in a place called hell. He said that if you are angry with your brother, you are already in hell. Anger <span class="italic">is </span>hell. He also said that you don't need to kill with your body to be put in jail. You need only to kill in your mind and you are already there.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In the Persian &nbsp;Gulf, many people practiced &nbsp;killing in their minds-Iraqi, American, French, British, and other soldiers. They knew that if they didn't kill, the enemy sol diers would kill them, so they used sandbags to represent their enemy, and holding their bayonets firmly, they ran, shouted, and plunged &nbsp;the &nbsp;bayonets &nbsp;into &nbsp;the sandbags. They &nbsp;practiced killing day and night in their hearts and minds. The damage caused by that kind of practice is huge. I happened to see a few seconds of that kind of practice on TV. Even if President Bush had not given the order for a land offensive, a lot of damage was already being done in the minds and hearts of one million people in the Gulf. Those kinds of wounds last for a long time and are transmitted &nbsp;to future generations. If you train yourself every day to kill during the day and then dream of killing during the night because you have spent so much time concentrating on that, the damage is deep. If you survive, you will bear that kind of scar for many years. This is a real tragedy. We usually count &nbsp;bodies to measure the damage from a war, but we don't count these kinds of wounds in the hearts and minds of so many soldiers. We have to see the real long-term damage that war causes. Soldiers live in hell day and night, even before they go into the battlefield, and even after they return home.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We may think of peace as the absence of war, that if the great powers would reduce their weapons arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we will see our own minds-our own prejudices, fears, and ignorance. &nbsp;Even if we transport all the &nbsp;bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of the bombs are still here-in our hearts and minds-and, sooner or later, we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To start a war and give the opportunity to one million men and women to practice killing day and night in their hearts is to plant many, many seeds of war-anger, frustration, and the fear of being killed. I felt very sad when I learned that more than eighty percent of the American people supported the Gulf War.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">if </span></span><span class="italic">any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also."</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This is Jesus' teaching about revenge. "When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When he wants to borrow something from you, lend it to him. How many Christians actually practice this? There &nbsp;is a story about an American soldier who was taking a Japanese prisoner during World War II. While walking together, the American discovered that the Japanese soldier spoke English and that he had been a Christian before he abandoned his faith. So he asked, "Why did you abandon Christianity? It is an excellent religion," and the Japanese man said, "I could not become a soldier and continue &nbsp;to be a Christian. I don't think a good Christian &nbsp;can become a soldier and kill another person." He understood this passage from Matthew. There &nbsp;must be ways to solve our conflicts without having to resort to killing. We must focus our attention &nbsp;on this. We have to find ways to help people get out of difficult situations, situations of conflict, without having to kill.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">"Ye </span></span><span class="italic">have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them &nbsp;that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This is nondiscrimination. When you pray only for your own picnic and not for the farmers who need the rain, you are doing the opposite &nbsp;of what Jesus taught. Jesus said, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you..." When we look deeply into our anger, we see that the person we call our enemy is also suffering. As soon as we see that, we have the capacity of accepting and having compassion for him. Jesus called this "loving your enemy." When we are able to love our enemy, he or she is no longer our enemy. The &nbsp;idea of "enemy" vanishes and is replaced by the no tion of someone suffering a great deal who needs our com passion. Doing &nbsp;this is sometimes &nbsp;easier than we might think, but we need to practice. If we read the Bible but don't practice, it will not help much.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.</span>" Everyone makes mistakes. If we are mindful, we see that &nbsp;some &nbsp;of our &nbsp;actions &nbsp;in the &nbsp;past may have caused others to suffer, and some actions of others &nbsp;have made us suffer. We want to be forgiving. We want to begin anew. "You, my brother or sister, have wronged me in the past. I now understand that it was because you were suffering and did not see clearly. I no longer feel anger towards you." That &nbsp;kind of forgiveness is the fruit of awareness. When you are mindful you can see all the causes that led the other person to make you suffer. When you see this, forgiveness &nbsp;and release arise naturally. You can't &nbsp;force yourself to forgive. Only when you understand &nbsp;what has happened can you have compassion for the other &nbsp;person and forgive him or her.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If President &nbsp;Bush had had more understanding of the mind of President Hussein, &nbsp;peace might have been obtained. President Gorbachev made a number of proposals that could have been acceptable &nbsp;to the allies, and many lives could have been spared. But because anger was there, Mr. Bush rejected &nbsp;Mr. Gorbachev's &nbsp;proposals, &nbsp;and Mr. Hussein gave the order to burn Kuwaiti oil wells. If President Bush had seen clearly the suffering of the Iraqi people, he would not have allowed his anger to be expressed by starting a war. He asked the American people to pray for the allied soldiers. He asked God to bless the United States of America. He did not say that we should pray for the civilians in Iraq &nbsp;or even the people&nbsp; of Kuwait. He wanted God to be on the side of America.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Eighty percent of the American people called the Persian Gulf War a victory-only a few hundred &nbsp;American soldiers were killed. But every human life is precious, and the loss of the 100,000 or more Iraqi people was a great tragedy! You may identify yourself as an American, but that is only partially true. You are more than that. You may have lost just a few hundred American lives, but you also suffered from the Gulf War in many other ways. The deaths of so many Iraqi soldiers and civilians are also casualties that America suffered, &nbsp;because their death was your country's work. When President Bush said, "God bless the United States of America," he was not paying enough attention to the lives of non-Americans. To those of us who are not American, this was not a good image of America. It was selfish and arrogant, and this was also a casualty that America suffered-not just by guns and bombs, but by your President's statement. If the President had said, "God bless us so that the war will end soon and that Americans as well as Iraqis will suffer as little as possible," he could have won a lot more sympathy from people around the world. But he did not say that.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Who is President Bush? President Bush is us. We are responsible &nbsp;for the way he feels, for everything he does. Eighty percent of the people in America supported him in this just war. Why blame him? Our capacity of loving and understanding was so limited. We were &nbsp;not &nbsp;peaceful enough in our own hearts, and we were not able to bring peace to the hearts of other people. When I saw how we prepared for war and practiced killing day and night in our hearts and minds, I felt overwhelmed.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">After the parades ended and the yellow ribbons were no longer there, what did we have? What did the wives, husbands, children, brothers, and sisters of the soldiers receive when their &nbsp;loved ones returned from the Gulf after so much fear, hatred, and killing-in reality and in their daily practice? We cannot imagine the long-term effects of watering so many seeds of war.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Please sit still, breathe, and look deeply, and you will see the real losses, the real casualties that America suffered and continues to suffer from the Gulf War. Visualize 500,000 allied soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia, waiting for the order to invade Iraq, jumping and screaming as they plunge their bayonets into sandbags that represent Iraqi soldiers. You cannot plunge a bayonet into a person without first transforming yourself into a beast. On the other side, one million Iraqi soldiers were practicing the same. One and a half million solders were practicing violence, hatred, and fear, and the American public supported &nbsp;them to do so. They thought that this war was somehow clean, quick, and moral. They saw only bridges and buildings &nbsp;being destroyed, but the real casualties were the souls of the men and women who came home after practicing violence for so many months.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">How could they do that and remain themselves? When they returned, &nbsp;the soldiers cried for joy; they were alive! Their &nbsp;parents, wives, husbands, children, and friends also cried for joy. But after one or two weeks, the war welled up from within their deepest consciousness, and their families and the whole of society will have to endure their pain for a long time. If you are a psychologist, a playwright, a novelist, a composer, &nbsp;a filmmaker, &nbsp;a lawyer, a legislator, a peacemaker, or an environmentalist, please look deeply into the souls of the soldiers who returned from the war so you can see the real suffering that war causes, not only to soldiers, but to everyone. Then &nbsp;project that image onto a huge screen for the whole nation to see and to learn. If we are able to share the truth &nbsp;concerning &nbsp;the Gulf War, we will be able to avoid starting another war like it in the future. We have to see how deep the wounds of war are. How could anyone call the Gulf War a victory? A victory for whom?</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-41"></div>

Just look at the way young &nbsp;people &nbsp;consume &nbsp;drugs, &nbsp;as a way to forget. These &nbsp;are the seeds of war, and we have to acknowledge this if we want to transform &nbsp;them. We have to do it together, looking deeply into the nature of the war in our collective consciousness. The war is in our souls.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Many of us are not healthy within, and yet we continue to look for things that only harm us more. We come home from work exhausted, and we do not know how to relax. We feel a kind of vacuum in ourselves, so we turn on the television. We live in a society where we always feel we are lacking something, and we want to fill it. If we don't turn on the TV, we eat or read or talk on the telephone. We are always trying to fill our void with something. Some people even do social or political work this way. But doing this only makes us less satisfied, hungrier, and we want to consume more. We feel alienated from ourselves. There &nbsp;is so much anger and fear in us, and we want to suppress them, so we consume more and more things that only increase the level of toxicity &nbsp;in us. We watch &nbsp;films filled with screaming and violence. We read magazines and novels filled with hatred and confusion. We do not even have the courage to turn off our TV, &nbsp;because we are afraid to go back to ourselves. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;night I heard President &nbsp;Bush give the order to attack Iraq, I could not sleep. I was angry and overwhelmed. The next morning in the middle of my lecture, I suddenly paused and told my friends, &nbsp;"I don't &nbsp;think I will go to North &nbsp;America this Spring." The &nbsp;words just sprang out. Then &nbsp;I continued &nbsp;the lecture. In the afternoon, &nbsp;one American student &nbsp;told me, "Thay, I think you have to go to the United States. Many friends there feel the same as you do, and it would help if you would go and support them." I did not say anything. I practiced breathing, walking, and sitting, &nbsp;and a few days later, I decided to go. I saw that I was one with the American people, with George Bush, and with Saddam Hussein. I had been angry with President Bush, but after breathing consciously and looking deeply, I saw myself as President &nbsp;Bush. I had not been practicing well enough to change this situation. &nbsp;I saw that Saddam Hussein&nbsp; was not the only person who lit the oil wells in Kuwait. All of us reached out our hands and lit them with him.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In our collective consciousness, there are some seeds of nonviolence, and President Bush did begin with sanctions. But we did not support and encourage him enough, so he switched &nbsp;to a more violent &nbsp;way. We cannot &nbsp;blame only him. The President acted the way he did because we acted the way we did. It is because we are not happy enough that we had a war. If we were happier, we would not take refuge in alcohol, drugs, war, and violence. Young people tell me that the most precious gift their parents can give is their own happiness. If Father and Mother &nbsp;themselves are happy, the children &nbsp;will receive seeds of happiness in their consciousness, and when they grow up, they will know how to make others happy too. When &nbsp;parents fight, they sow seeds of suffering in the hearts of their children, and with that kind of heritage, children grow up unhappy. These are the roots of war. If children are unhappy, they will look for other things that are exactly like war-alcohol, drugs, and some TV &nbsp;programs, &nbsp;magazines, films, and other &nbsp;violent "cultural products."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Our society is sick. When we put a young person in this society without trying to protect him or her, he or she will receive violence, hatred, and fear every day and get sick. Our conversations, our TV programs, our advertisements, our newspapers, our magazines all water the seeds of suffering in young people and not-so-young people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">How can we transform our individual consciousness and the collective consciousness of our society? How can we refrain from consuming more toxic cultural products? We need guidelines-a diet-and we need to practice watering the seeds of peace, joy, and happiness in ourselves. The most important practice for preventing war is to stay in touch with what is refreshing, healing, and joyful inside us and all around us. If we practice walking mindfully, being in touch with the earth, &nbsp;the air, the trees, and ourselves, we can heal ourselves, and our entire society will also be healed. If the whole nation would practice watering seeds of joy and peace and not just seeds of anger and violence, the elements of war in all of us will be transformed.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We must prepare ourselves, whether we have one minute, ten years, or one thousand &nbsp;years. If we don't &nbsp;have time, there is no use in discussing peace, because you cannot practice peace without&nbsp; time. If you have one minute, please use that minute &nbsp;to breathe &nbsp;in and out calmly and plant the seeds of peace and understanding in yourself. If you have ten years, please use the ten years to prevent the next war. If you have one thousand &nbsp;years, please use the time to prevent the destruction of our planet.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;Transformation &nbsp;is possible, but it takes time. There are already seeds of peace in those we call "hawks," but they need us to water their seeds of peace and understanding or else their seeds of anger and aggression will continue to dominate them. Do not feel discouraged. Just by your way of looking at things and doing things, you influence others. Approach everyone with love and patience, and try to water the positive seeds in them. We have to help each other, being skillful, kind, and understanding. Blaming and arguing never help.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">People everywhere saw the Los Angeles policemen beating Rodney King. When I first saw that video on French Tv, I felt that I was the one being beaten, and I suffered a lot. I think you must have felt the same. All of us were beaten at the same time. We were all victims of violence, anger, misunderstanding, and the lack of respect for our human dignity.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">But as I looked more deeply, I saw that the policemen beating Rodney King were no different from myself. They were doing it because our society is filled with hatred and violence. Everything is like a bomb ready to explode, and we are all a part of that bomb; we are all co-responsible. We are all the policemen <span class="italic">and </span>the victim.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In the practice of mindfulness, we nurture the ability to see deeply into&nbsp; the nature &nbsp;of things and people, and the fruit is insight, understanding, &nbsp;and love. Because we have not practiced deeply enough, violence has become the substance of our society. Putting the policemen in jail will not solve this fundamental &nbsp;problem. We accept violence as a way of life and as a way to deal with problems. If we are not mindful-if we do not transform our shared suffering through &nbsp;compassion and deep understanding-then one day our child will be the one who is beaten, or the one doing the beating. It is very much our affair. We have to look at the roots of the problem and not just on the surface.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-42"></div>

That &nbsp;was in 1987, and since then, I have begun to lead retreats for war veterans. I want veterans to realize how important they are.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I, too, am a veteran. I lost many friends-many brothers and sisters-during the Vietnam War, and I experienced much suffering. Grenades were thrown into my room, but were deflected by a curtain. Social service workers under my direction were killed and maimed. We did our best to confront the violence with love, but we had to cry a lot.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I have been practicing to transform &nbsp;my suffering &nbsp;and share my insight with others. I do not feel any more blame. I feel peace and compassion, and that allows me to help other people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Veterans are the light at the tip of the candle, illuminating the way for the whole nation. If veterans can achieve awareness, transformation, understanding, and peace, they can share with the rest of society the realities of war. And they can teach us how to make peace with ourselves and each other, so we never have to use violence to resolve conflicts again. To make the world a peaceful place, to ensure for our children and grandchildren &nbsp;a life worth living, we need a transformation. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When &nbsp;you touch fire and your hand gets burned, it is not the responsibility of the hand alone. It is the responsibility of the whole person. The hand did not touch the fire by itself. It was commanded to do so by the brain, and the whole body got hurt at the same time. If the body blames the hand, that is not just. The hand acted because the body ordered &nbsp;it to do so. When &nbsp;there is good communication between the hand and the rest of the body, both the hand and the body will feel better. If the body says, "You must bear the burden of your actions by yourself; I cannot for give what you have done," that is the lack of understand ing.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When you went to war, you went for the whole nation. The whole nation &nbsp;was responsible for what happened there, not you alone. Your hand was the hand of the whole nation. If you made mistakes, the whole nation made mistakes. If you went to war believing you were doing something important-trying to save a people, fighting evil-it was not your thinking &nbsp;alone; it was the thinking &nbsp;of the whole nation. You were sent there to fight, destroy, kill, and die. You were not the only one responsible. We cannot just shout at you and say, "You did that!" We all did it collectively.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Our individual consciousness is a product of our society, ancestors, education, and many other factors. Your sense of duty, service, and freedom were handed to you by society, and you went to war as representatives of your people, not just as individuals. You have to look deeply to understand what really happened. Your personal healing will be the healing of the whole nation, your children, and their children. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When the hand gets burned, if there is good communication with the rest of the body, blood and other fluids will rush to the wound and begin the process of healing. If the nation comes to understand the true nature of the war, loving kindness will begin to surface, and healing will begin. As long as there is no communication, there is no insight or compassion, and you will continue to suffer. Non-veterans do not understand veterans, and they refuse to listen to you. You know the truth about war, but you have not been able to share your insight with them. You have suffered so much, but you have not been able to find ways to tell people about it, and they have not been ready to listen.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">You continue to suffer, because you feel guilty about your actions in Vietnam. Shame, guilt, and regret can be helpful or harmful; it depends how you use them. When you realize that you have caused a lot of damage, if you vow not to do it again, that regret is wholesome and beneficial. But if your guilt persists for too long and becomes a complex, it blocks the way to joy and peace. The &nbsp;way to liberate &nbsp;yourself is to look deeply into the nature&nbsp; of the guilt and self-hatred &nbsp;and see the seeds of the suffering your ancestors, your parents, and the violence and lack of understanding in our society and its institutions. If you went to Vietnam with such a heritage of suffering, your actions were dictated &nbsp;by those forces. That is also true of those who opposed the war.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;seeds&nbsp; of suffering come &nbsp;from &nbsp;many directions. When your parents conceived you, you already had many seeds of happiness and suffering handed down by your ancestors. In your mother's womb, you received more seeds. If your &nbsp;parents were &nbsp;not &nbsp;happy &nbsp;together, you &nbsp;received seeds of suffering.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">As you grew up, if your parents &nbsp;argued &nbsp;and made each other &nbsp;unhappy, you received those seeds of suffering, &nbsp;too. If your &nbsp;parents were alcoholic, they &nbsp;made you suffer. If your father abused you, you suffered. Violent films and TV programs also watered &nbsp;the seeds of fear and hatred in you. By the time you became a soldier, you were already filled with suffering. Then, in the army you were told that &nbsp;the Vietnamese were beasts and you had to kill them. You cannot kill another human &nbsp;being without visualizing him as a beast. The &nbsp;mass media reinforced &nbsp;this image, watering &nbsp;the seeds of hatred and fear in order &nbsp;to help you kill. So many seeds of violence &nbsp;were watered &nbsp;before &nbsp;you were a soldier and during the time you were a soldier.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">With &nbsp;such a heritage of suffering, it is no surprise that you committed atrocities during the war. You knew you could be killed at any time. You saw your friends killed in ambushes. You became &nbsp;more &nbsp;and more &nbsp;angry &nbsp;and&nbsp; more and more afraid. You may have killed children and women. You may have raped &nbsp;women &nbsp;or destroyed villages out of the fear, hatred,&nbsp; and rage that were pouring &nbsp;into you from so many directions. If you committed atrocities in Vietnam, it was the act of everyone-your father &nbsp;who abused you, the&nbsp; press, your &nbsp;commander, everyone who watered the seeds of anger in you so that you could kill.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We do not need to go overseas to a war zone to see such violence. The Los Angeles policemen beating Rodney King, &nbsp;that &nbsp;was also Vietnam. War &nbsp;manifests itself &nbsp;in so many ways here and now. It is a reflection of our collective consciousness, which &nbsp;is filled &nbsp;with &nbsp;suffering. With this heritage, the violence &nbsp;will repeat &nbsp;itself&nbsp; over and over. There will be other Vietnams, other Gulf Wars. It is our task to look deeply into the violence, hatred, and fear to see their roots.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Many soldiers who went to Vietnam had almost no contact with the Vietnamese &nbsp;people, &nbsp;culture, or life. They were told that the Vietnamese needed to be killed because they were evil and they were killers. Because it was a high-tech war, you just pushed buttons &nbsp;to complete &nbsp;many of your missions. You did not know or see the damage you were inflicting on the people and the country of Vietnam. If you flew one hundred &nbsp;missions, you might have been successful as a soldier, but you did not know what was happening on the ground, because you were so far away. Once you realized what was happening on the ground, you began to have guilt.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Who did that bombing? Your President, your Congress,</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">your Senate, &nbsp;your&nbsp; people, everyone.&nbsp; You were only the hand ordered &nbsp;to do it. Why keep the regret for yourself? Why keep the shame for yourself? When you begin to see that, you will be free, and we need you to share your insight &nbsp;with everyone &nbsp;so we will not be tempted &nbsp;to do it again.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When you came home after the war, the American people were cool, neglectful, and unappreciative, and of course you became angry. But your people did not know anything about &nbsp;the war. Both hawks and doves had a very wrong view. You experienced the reality firsthand, and when you see that they were speaking out of ignorance, you will stop being angry at them. You were ignorant&nbsp; too, but now you have learned, and you are liberated from your anger. Now you can offer your compassion.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We who have experienced war directly have a responsibility to share our insight and experience concerning &nbsp;the truth of war. We are the light at the tip of the candle. It is very hot, but it has the power of shining and illuminating. We can gather into groups to support each other. Practicing mindfulness, we will know how to look deeply into the nature of the war and, with our insight, awaken our own people. We know what war is. We also know that the war is not only in us; it is in everyone-veterans and non-veterans. We must share our insight, not out of anger, but out of love. Our people need us to do it. I am trying my best, and I hope my friends will do the same.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">During the war, one portion of the American population had to confront one portion of the Vietnamese population. These were the soldiers, the combatants. But the combatants and the non-combatants were not so different. In both, there were conflicts, and we have to look deeply to recognize these conflicts so that we can transform &nbsp;them into understanding and compassion, &nbsp;the fruit of insight. Insight can be brought about by mindfulness and looking deeply. If we do not have enough &nbsp;mindfulness, &nbsp;if we do not make enough &nbsp;effort to look deeply, we will not have enough insight to transform &nbsp;the conflicts that are within us, not to mention &nbsp;those between people and those with other nations.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;basic condition for happiness is to be understood. Our &nbsp;pain, hope, and despair &nbsp;have to be understood &nbsp;by someone for us to be happy. Vietnam veterans do not feel understood by their society, not even by members of their own &nbsp;families. &nbsp;Consciously or &nbsp;unconsciously, veterans blame &nbsp;the &nbsp;non-veterans for &nbsp;not &nbsp;understanding them. There is so much misunderstanding to be dissolved. Veterans have suffered so much, and they have to take the time to understand their&nbsp; own suffering. It may look as if the people of America understand &nbsp;Gulf War veterans better, but I don't think so. Our ignorance about the nature of war is exactly the same. The war in Vietnam and the war in the Gulf were the same. It does not change &nbsp;just by the way people welcome you back. Whether they shout at you or wave flags and welcome you, the true nature of the war is the same. We have to see that.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Many years have now passed since the Vietnam War. We are calm enough to realize that the Vietnam War was not necessary. We spent so much energy, so many human lives-millions of people died in Vietnam. There are still a lot of mines and bombs in Vietnam that have not been defused, and there are also many bombs in our souls that have not been defused. We need to defuse the bombs in our souls first. Then we can go to Vietnam to help defuse the bombs there.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When we look deeply, we can see that all wars have their roots in the lack of understanding. We may be a little wiser now that twenty years have passed since the Vietnam War, but are we wise enough to prevent another war? In fact, we have already had another unnecessary war. In order to prevent yet another, we have to be prepared. We need time, of course, but we also need a way. If we know what to do, how to prepare, time is of secondary importance. We have to practice in a way that helps the whole nation see deeply into the nature of war. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When &nbsp;you look into your consciousness &nbsp;and see your own pain, you also see the suffering and confusion of your society and your government. You have been embracing your suffering for many years, but when you see it directly, <span class="italic">it </span>will transform itself into a positive source of energy that will empower you to share your insight. To help others, we have to go to them with arms extended, filled with loving kindness and compassion. Blaming others or blaming ourselves can never help. The moment we have this insight, we will stop blaming, we will stop suffering, and we will have the energy to serve our people, even <span class="italic">if </span>they are still ignorant about the nature of the war.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">No one ever wins a war. The Vietnamese did not win the war. Millions of people in Vietnam are still suffering, and the country has been destroyed. Vietnam did not win anything. We cannot call it a victory. You cannot call the Gulf War a victory either. But many Americans did call it a victory, so they could have the feeling once again that America is the greatest power on Earth. They organized parades welcoming the soldiers back, trying to overcome what they called a defeat many years ago.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I don't see any difference between a Vietnam veteran and a Gulf War veteran. I don't see any difference between the nature &nbsp;of the war in Vietnam and the nature of the Gulf War. I don't see any difference between the consciousness of the people during the Vietnam War and the consciousness of the people during the Gulf War. Please look deeply and remove all of these false distinctions. Look deeply to see the true nature of our society and our collective consciousness. If the people &nbsp;are educated, if the truth can break into their souls, we will all be able to go in the direction of peace.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">As long as the American people believe that &nbsp;the Gulf War was moral, just, and liberating, they will be tempted to do the same thing the next time there is a conflict. How can we prevent that? By telling the truth, &nbsp;by sharing our insight. We need to look deeply and to share our insights. We do not have time to embrace our pain in private anymore. We have to reveal ourselves. We have to allow our selves to be the light at the tip of the candle, and to join with other veterans. We who have had firsthand experience can share the reality with everyone.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Transformation is the key. Looking just into the ocean of suffering, you see&nbsp; that &nbsp;it is immense. But if you turn around, you see the land. It is possible to transform &nbsp;our hearts right in the present moment. If we do it, if we vow to go in the direction of peace and service, a rose will be born in us at that very moment. My brothers &nbsp;and sisters who died during the war have been reborn as flowers. We have to harvest those flowers and form a beautiful bouquet. Please don't dwell on your memory of guilt. If we can learn from our suffering, all of those flowers will smile deeply at us, and we will be free.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I wrote this poem during the war. Like you, I suffered alot, but transformation was taking place right there in the midst of the war. It is not too late. I know you can do the same.<span class="calibre4">

The &nbsp;tree did not answer right away. So I sat at its roots and waited. The &nbsp;backyard was covered with brilliantly colored leaves, the air was fresh, and suddenly I forgot that I was waiting for an answer. The &nbsp;tree and I were just there, enjoying ourselves and each other. After sitting for a long time, I turned to the tree, smiled, and said, "I no longer need an answer." Then &nbsp;I thanked it and awarded it the Grand Transnational Peace Prize.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When &nbsp;I told my friends this, one asked, "Do you give the Peace Prize often?" I did not know how to answer. I wanted to, but it was difficult. Then another asked, "What was the tree's answer to your question?" Again, I did not know what to say, so I encouraged &nbsp;her to go out and ask the tree.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">As a novice monk, I was taught to look deeply at a cypress tree, and I learned that looking at a cypress can be very helpful. In fact, it is often easier to contemplate a cypress than to talk to a person. Before talking to a human being, watching a cypress can help. Soon I will organize an International Conference on Tree-Watching. All of the conferees will sit in the forest and just look at beautiful cypresses and pines. Then, in workshops, we can discuss strategies for tree-watching and also principles for appreciating human beings, even those who do not look or think exactly as we do. When I told this to the pine tree, it began to laugh. The tree was thinking about a particular conference held at a Hilton &nbsp;Hotel dealing with the problems of the Third World. Not a single Third World representative had the opportunity to speak because eloquent spokespersons from the First World spoke for them. It was too difficult for them to listen to real Third World representatives, especially those whose ideas did not fit in with their own.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;I have lost my brother and I don't know where and how to find him. My brother was accused of destroying the community because he wanted to do things differently. Now the community continues, but my brother is missing. I have been on a pilgrimage for years looking for him, but without your help, I will never succeed.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Yesterday, I stood in a park and watched a three-year-old child with all my attention, and I was heartbroken. When people say, "Things aren't too bad," I am not sure they understand. If we continue to live the way we do, what kind of world are we leaving for our children? Are we leaving any world at all?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I know my brother is still alive, and I will travel all over the world to find him. But I really need your help. Will you help me? He may be hard to recognize, but I believe the &nbsp;time is near. When &nbsp;the rest of us were asleep, &nbsp;my brother saw what was happening. He tried to tell us, but we never listened. We were busy doing &nbsp;other &nbsp;things practicing meditation, praying, reciting scriptures. We were not at all awake. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">People thought my brother was dangerous, but it is not true. He is outspoken, but not dangerous. In fact, not listening to him is what is dangerous. &nbsp;One person like my brother counts for a lot. When I think of him, I know that peace is possible. Please help me find him. If we succeed, there will be hope.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If we try to remove the bombs from a distance, we can never succeed. The &nbsp;bombs are us, and my brother understands that. He asked why we export conventional weapons to the poorest countries of the Third &nbsp;World while people there are starving. I am not trying to make you sad. I just want to share some of the things my brother said.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When I look at the three-year-old child, when I look at the pine tree, I feel co-responsible for their futures. I have no money and no weapons, but I know that by not being attentive enough, I have allowed the situation to develop this far. We are all much too busy. If my brother &nbsp;returns home soon, we will have a chance. That is what I feel. But I am not sure all of us will be able to listen to him or understand him. We only have a chance if we are able to hear and truly understand him. If we are, we may be willing to change our ways. We still do not know how to take care of him. So, we have to prepare. We have to look deeply into our daily lives, at the ways we think and act, and begin to live in a way that allows the return &nbsp;of my brother &nbsp;to be possible, that allows a future to be possible.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">My brother said, "Each person is important. Each being is important. Each moment is important." I am sure the pine tree and the three-year-old child understand this. Our opportunity for peace is not later. It is now. My brother was considered too dangerous for the material well-being of the community. He was a little too radical, too outspoken. That is why we did not want him. But I can assure you that one person like my brother &nbsp;counts for a lot. I have confidence in my brother now, because as I think of him, I feel that anything is possible. Please help. Please be attentive. If you are attentive enough, you will find my brother. Please do not leave me in distress. Tell me, write me, telephone me the moment you see him. I know it may be hard to recognize him, but he is around. He may be living in a monastery or he may be somewhere on the street or in the marketplace. Or he may be within your own heart.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-44"></div>

The project was called, "When blood is shed, we all suffer." At that time, not many people knew about the presence of the boat people, and the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore would not allow them to land on their shores. The practice was to push the boat people back out to sea so they would die, and those on land would not have to deal with them.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We hired two large ships-the <span class="italic">Leapdal </span>and the <span class="italic">Roland </span>to pick up refugees on the open sea, and two small ships the <span class="italic">Saigon 200 </span>and the <span class="italic">Blackmark-to </span>communicate &nbsp;between the larger ships and to transport water, food, medicine, and supplies. Our plan was to fill the two large ships with refugees and take them to Australia and Guam, where, on arrival, we would inform the press so that the world would take notice of their plight, and they would not be sent back. In Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries, thousands of boat people had been sent back and many of them died in the sea. We had to do our work in secret, since the governments of the world did not want to acknowledge the plight of the boat people, and we knew we would be deported from Singapore if we were discovered. We managed to rescue nearly 800 boat people from the Gulf of Siam. On New Year's Eve, I rode out to sea in the small <span class="italic">Saigon 200 </span>to talk with the refugees on the larger ships. Using a wireless telephone, I wished them a Happy New Year. After we said good-bye, I headed back to shore, and, in the darkness, a huge wave welled up and drenched me. I had the impression that the power of darkness was warning me, "It is the fate of these people to die. Why are<span class="calibre4">
</span>you interfering?"</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;Sometimes we asked fishermen to pick these boat people up during the night, and then we took them by taxi to the French Embassy. In the morning, they were discovered by the French Ambassador, who was very kind. He called the police, knowing that because of his awareness of the presence of these people, they would get "illegal refugee" status. Even though they were put in prison, it was far better than being sent back to sea. Then we worked to help these people get accepted to go to France. We were trying to do many things to reverse the situation.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;From time to time, we saw things you cannot &nbsp;believe. We met with a group of sixty people in a barracks. They had just destroyed &nbsp;their own boat so that the Malaysian police would not send them back out to sea, but the police were trying to repair their&nbsp; boat in order &nbsp;to do just that. When we saw these people, the men were just staring into empty space, and the women and children could not stop crying. One of them told us that they came with two boats. The Malaysian police had given them some water and told them to go to Singapore, where they would be welcomed, but this was not &nbsp;true-the Singaporeans always towed boats back out into the ocean no matter how dangerous it was for the boat people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When &nbsp;the two boats tried to sail away from Malaysia, one capsized. The sixty people on this boat had witnessed the deaths of everyone on the other boat, right in front of their eyes, and there was nothing they could do to help. So they decided to return to the shores of Malaysia, and this time they destroyed and sank their own boat the moment they arrived. They &nbsp;did not want to be pushed out to sea again. We immediately went to the nearest town and called Reuters, AFP, and other &nbsp;media people to come and take photographs. Because of this, the police did not send them back out to sea, but instead brought &nbsp;them to prison and later to a refugee camp.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;suffering we touched doing this kind of work was so deep&nbsp; that &nbsp;if we did not &nbsp;have a reservoir &nbsp;of spiritual strength, we would not have been able to continue. During those days, we practiced sitting &nbsp;and walking meditation, and eating our meals in silence in a very concentrated way. We knew that without this kind of discipline, we would fail in our work. The &nbsp;lives of many people depended on our mindfulness.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;After we had rescued nearly 800 people from small boats at sea, the government of Singapore discovered &nbsp;us. We were close to succeeding in sending &nbsp;the <span class="italic">Roland </span>and the <span class="italic">Leapdal </span>to Australia, but because of a leak to the press, several reporters tracked us down and published a story about our project. The press is sometimes &nbsp;frivolous; they just want to write a story, even if human lives are at stake. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Because we had been exposed, the Singapore authorities gave the order for the police to surround &nbsp;our flat at two o'clock in the morning. Two policemen were at the front door, two at the back, and two came in to get me. They took my travel documents and ordered me to leave the country within twenty-four hours. I knew that two large boatloads of people were waiting &nbsp;for me to help bring them to shore. The police said, "We will return your travel documents at the airport tomorrow." Those policemen were not like human beings. They were unable to understand the suffering of the boat people or how we were <span class="calibre4">try</span>ing to help them.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;What &nbsp;could we do in such a situation? We had to breathe deeply and consciously. Otherwise we might panic, or fight with the police, or do something to express our anger at their lack of humanity. Knowing that in twenty-four hours we had to leave 800 people on two boats without food and water, what could we do? We could not go back to sleep.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;At that time of the night, no one would answer phone calls. Even the French Embassy was not open. So all of us practiced walking meditation inside our small flat for the rest of the night. If you practice conscious breathing before some difficulty arises, you will be prepared.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;We had to find a way for 800 people to travel safely to Australia &nbsp;or Guam. The &nbsp;<span class="italic">Saigon 200 </span>and the <span class="italic">Blackmark </span>were not allowed to leave port to take food and water to the refugees on the <span class="italic">Leapdal </span>and the <span class="italic">Roland. </span>The <span class="italic">Roland </span>had enough fuel to reach Australia, but we needed to get food to them. Then its engine broke down. The day was very windy and the sea quite rough, and we worried about their safety, even just drifting offshore. But the Malaysian government would &nbsp;not &nbsp;allow the ship &nbsp;to enter &nbsp;Malaysian waters. I tried to get permission &nbsp;to enter &nbsp;a neighboring country in order to continue the rescue operation, but the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia would not grant me an entry visa. Even though I was on land, I too was drifting on the sea·, and my life was one with the 800 refugees on the ships. There were more problems than seemed possible to solve in just twenty-four hours.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I decided to practice the meditation topic, "If you want peace, peace is with you immediately," and I was surprised to find myself quite calm, not afraid or worried about anything. I was not just being careless. This was truly a peaceful state of mind, and in that state, I was able to overcome this difficult &nbsp;situation. The &nbsp;idea came to me to ask the French Embassy to intervene on my behalf so that my visa would be extended for a few more days, enough time to tie up all of these loose ends. And at five minutes before noon, just as the Immigration Department was about to close for the weekend and I would have to leave the country, the ex tension was granted. As long as I live, I will never forget those seconds of sitting meditation, &nbsp;those breaths, those mindful steps during that night and that morning. Success came when I faced the problem directly. I vowed that if I could not have peace at that moment, &nbsp;I would never be able to have peace. If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, the kind of peace I might realize in easier times would not mean anything. Practicing the topic, "If you want peace, peace is with you immediately," I was able to resolve many problems one after another. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We had to hand the refugees over to the United Nations High &nbsp;Commissioner for Refugees, &nbsp;who kept them &nbsp;for months and years in the camps in Malaysia. It was very painful. Yet we had conducted our operation in prayer and meditation, because we knew that everything depended on our mindfulness. We did sitting &nbsp;meditation &nbsp;late into the night every night, &nbsp;then recited the <span class="italic">Heart Sutra, </span>as if we were in a monastery.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">&nbsp;Our work did bring the cries of the boat people to the attention &nbsp;of the world. In 1977, the U.S. government increased the quota for Vietnamese &nbsp;refugees to 7,000 per year, then 15,000, then 100,000. Australia and other countries followed suit. If we do our best, in full awareness and with a heart free from anger, we cannot worry about results.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-45"></div>

Our presidents and our governments &nbsp;are us. They &nbsp;reflect our lifestyle and our way of thinking. The &nbsp;way we hold a cup of tea, pick up a newspaper, and even use toilet paper have to do with peace. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5">As a novice in a Buddhist monastery, I was taught to be aware of each thing I did throughout the day, and for more than fifty years, I have been practicing this. When I started, I thought this kind of practice was only for beginners, that advanced people did more important things, but now I know that &nbsp;the practice &nbsp;of mindfulness is for everyone. Meditation &nbsp;is to see into our own nature and wake up. If we are not aware of what is going on in ourselves and in the world, how can we see into our own nature and wake up? Are we really awake when we drink our tea, read our newspaper, or use the toilet?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Our society makes it difficult for us to be awake. There are so many distractions. We know that 40,000 children in the Third World die of hunger every day, but we keep forgetting. Our society makes us forgetful. That &nbsp;is why we need practice to help us be mindful. I know a number of friends &nbsp;who refrain &nbsp;from eating &nbsp;dinner &nbsp;two times each week in order &nbsp;to remember the situation in the Third World.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">One day I asked a young Vietnamese refugee who was eating a bowl of rice whether children in his country eat rice of such high quality. He said no, because he knows the situation. He experienced hunger in Vietnam-there were times when he ate only dried potatoes, while he longed for a bowl of rice. In France, he has been eating rice for a year, and he is already beginning &nbsp;to forget. But when I asked him, he remembered. I could not ask the same question to a French or American child, because they have not had the experience of hunger. It is difficult for people in the West to understand the situation in the Third World. It seems to have nothing to do with their situation. I told the Vietnamese boy that the rice he was eating in France came from Thailand, and that most Thai children do not have rice of such high quality, because the best rice is set aside for ex port to Japan and the West in exchange for foreign currency.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In Vietnam we have a delicious banana called<span class="italic">chuối già</span><span class="italic">, </span>but the children &nbsp;and adults in Vietnam do not have the right to eat these bananas because they are all for export. In return, Vietnam gets guns in order to kill ourselves and our brothers. Some of us practice this exercise of mindfulness: We sponsor a child in the Third World and get news from him or her, thus keeping in touch with the reality outside. We try many ways to be awake, but our society still keeps us forgetful. Meditation is to help us remember. There are other &nbsp;ways to nourish awareness. One thirteen-year-old Dutch &nbsp;boy visited our retreat center &nbsp;and joined us for a silent lunch. It was the first time he had eaten in silence, and he was embarrassed. Afterwards, I asked him if he had felt uncomfortable, and he said yes. I explained that the reason we eat in silence is to be in touch with the food and the presence of each other. If we talk a lot, we cannot enjoy these things. I asked him if there was some time when he turned off the TV in order to enjoy his dinner &nbsp;more, and he said yes. Later in the day, I invited him to join us for another &nbsp;silent meal, and he enjoyed it very much. Society bombards us with so many noises that we have lost our taste for silence. Every time we have a few minutes, we turn on the TV or make a phone call. We do not know how to be ourselves without something &nbsp;to distract us. So, the first thing we need to do is to return to ourselves and reorganize our daily lives so that we are not just victims of society and other people.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To educate people for peace, we can use words or we can speak with our lives. If we are not peaceful, if we are not feeling well in our skin, we cannot demonstrate real peace, and we cannot raise our children well either. To take good care of our children means to take good care of ourselves, to be aware of our situation. Please sit down with your child and, together, contemplate the little &nbsp;flowers &nbsp;that grow among the grasses. Breathing in and out, smiling together-that is real peace education. When we can learn to appreciate these small, beautiful things, we will not have to search for anything else. We can be peace ourselves, and we can make peace with our friends and even with our so called enemies.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-46"></div>

We asked some native mountain people for their help, and two Montagnards &nbsp;from the Jarai tribe joined us in clearing the forest, cutting trees into lumber, and gathering other materials for construction. They were hard workers, and we were grateful for their assistance. But after working with us only three days, they stopped coming. Without their help, we had many difficulties, as we were not familiar with the ways of the forest. So we walked to their village and asked what had happened. They said, "Why should we return so soon? You already paid us enough to live for a month! We will come again when we run out of rice." At the time, it was a common practice to un derpay the Montagnards, &nbsp;to avoid just this kind of thing. We had paid them properly, and, surely enough, they stopped coming.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Many people criticized the Montagnards for this ethic.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">They said that this laziness could only lead to trouble, and they listed four reasons to support &nbsp;their claim: (1) The Montagnards would be happier and more comfortable if they would work harder. (2) They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods. (3) The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others. (4) If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasions and the exploitation of others. There may be some validity to each of these points, but if we look closely at the lives of the Montagnards, we will come to understand them, and ourselves, better.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">1. The Montagnards &nbsp;would be happier and more comfortable if</span><span class="calibre2">
</span><span class="italic">they would work harder.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5">The Montagnards lived simply. They did not store much food at all. They had no bank accounts. &nbsp;But they were much more serene and at peace with themselves, nature, and other &nbsp;people, than almost anyone in the world. I am not suggesting that we all return &nbsp;to primitive life-styles, but it is important&nbsp; that we see and appreciate the wisdom contained in a life-style like this, a wisdom that those of us immersed &nbsp;in modernization and economic &nbsp;growth have lost.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">How much stuff do we need to be happy and comfortable? Happiness and comfort vary according to taste. Some people think they need three or four houses-one on the Riviera, one in New York, one in Tokyo, and perhaps one in Fiji. Others find that a two or three-room hut is quite enough. In fact, if you own a dozen luxurious houses, you may rarely have time to enjoy them. Even when you have the time, you may not know how to sit peacefully in one place. Always seeking distraction-going to restaurants, the theater, or dinner parties, or taking vacations that exhaust you even more, you can't stand being alone and facing yourself directly.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In former times, people spent hours drinking one cup of tea with dear friends. A cup of tea does not cost much, but today, we go to a cafe and take less than five minutes &nbsp;to drink our tea or coffee, and even during that short time, we are mostly thinking and talking about other things, and we never even notice our tea. We who own just one house barely have the time to live in it. We leave home early in the morning &nbsp;after a quick breakfast and go off to work, spending an hour in the car or the train and the rest of the day in the office. Then we return home exhausted, eat dinner, watch TV, and collapse so we can get up early for work. Is this "progress"?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The Montagnards &nbsp;were quite content to live in simple bamboo &nbsp;and palm-leaf &nbsp;huts and wash their &nbsp;clothes &nbsp;by hand. They &nbsp;refused to be slaves to economic pressures. Content with just a few possessions, they rarely needed to spend their time or money seeing doctors or psychotherapists for stress-related ailments.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre3">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4">&nbsp;2. <span class="italic">They would earn more money, which they could save for difficult periods.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4">How much do we need to save? We do not save air, because we trust that it will be available to us when we need it. Why must we stockpile food, money, or other things for our own private use, while so many others are hungry?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4">People who accumulate a house, a car, a position, and so forth, identify themselves with what they own, and they think that if they lose their house, their car, or their position, they would not be themselves. To me, they are already lost. By accumulating &nbsp;and saving, they have constructed a false self, and in the process they have forgotten their truest and deepest self. Psychotherapists &nbsp;can try to help, but the cause of this illness is in their way of life. One way to help such a person would be to place him in an "underdeveloped" country where he could grow <span class="italic">his </span>own food and make his own clothes. Sharing the fate and simple life of peasants might help him heal quickly.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We have enough resources and know-how to assure every human being of adequate shelter and food every day. If we don't help others live, we ourselves are not going to be able to live either. We are all in the same boat-the planet Earth. Why not put our efforts into trying to help each other and save our boat instead of accumulating savings only for ourselves and our own children?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre3">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">3.The Montagnards should work harder in order to help others.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Of course, the Montagnards could have spent more time working in order to send aid to people who were starving in other parts of the world. If they did not do so, it was because they didn't know much about the existence of other nations. They certainly did help their own tribal members whenever they got sick or when a crop was destroyed by some natural disaster. But let us reflect for a moment on<span class="italic">
</span>what the Montagnard people did <span class="italic">not </span>do.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_10">They did not harm or exploit others. They grew their own food and exchanged some of their products with other people. They did not do violence to nature. They cut only enough &nbsp;wood to build their &nbsp;houses. They &nbsp;cleared &nbsp;only enough land to plant their crops. Because of their simple life-style, &nbsp;they did not overconsume natural &nbsp;resources. They did not pollute the air, water, or soil. They used very little fuel and no electricity. They did not own private cars, dishwashers, or electric razors. The way they lived enabled natural resources to continually renew themselves. A lifestyle like theirs demonstrates that a future for humankind is possible, and this is the most helpful thing anyone can do to help others.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="calibre_4"><span class="italic">4. If they would work harder, they would have the means to defend themselves from invasion and the exploitation of others.</span>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">It is true that the Montagnards were exploited by others and were often victims of social injustice. They lived in re mote mountain areas. If others settled nearby, they risked losing their land due to a lack of means with which to defend themselves.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">People said that if the rest of us in Vietnam worked as little as they did, our country would never be able to resist foreign intervention &nbsp;and exploitation. It seems clear that the Montagnards and others &nbsp;like them had to do something &nbsp;more. But what? If the Montagnards would have moved down to the more populated areas, they would have seen men and women working extremely hard and getting poorer. They would have seen how expensive food, lodging, electricity, water, clothing, and transportation were. Their civilized countrymen were working all day long and could barely pay for the most basic items they consumed. The Montagnards in the forest did not need to spend any money. If they would have lived and worked in the cities, how would that have helped Vietnam resist foreign intervention? &nbsp;All they would have learned &nbsp;is that in the socalled developed nations, resources are used to make bombs and other elaborate weapons, while many citizens live in misery. The Montagnards might well need nuclear weapons to resist foreign intervention if they were to catch up with their more "developed" brothers and sisters. Will social injustice ever be abolished before all people wake up and realize that unless we let others live, we ourselves will not be able to live?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Economic growth may be necessary for the welfare of people, &nbsp;but the present &nbsp;rate of economic &nbsp;growth &nbsp;is destroying &nbsp;humanity &nbsp;and nature. Injustice is rampant. &nbsp;We humans are part of nature, and doing harm to nature only harms us. It is not just the poor and oppressed who are victims &nbsp;of environmental damage. &nbsp;The &nbsp;affluent &nbsp;are &nbsp;just as much victims of pollution &nbsp;and the exploitation &nbsp;of resources. We must look at the whole picture and ask, "Does our way of life harm nature? Does our way of life harm our fellow humans? Do we live at the expense of others, at the expense of the present, and at the expense of the future?" If we answer truthfully, we will know how to orient our lives and our actions. We have much to learn from the Montagnards and others like them. We must learn to live in a way that makes a future possible.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-47"></div>

Then we ask, "How should we deal with nature?" We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! Nonviolently. We should not harm ourselves, and we should not harm nature. To harm nature is to harm ourselves, and vice versa. If we knew how to deal with ourselves and our fellow human beings, we would know how to deal with nature. Human beings and nature are inseparable. By not caring properly for either, we harm both.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We can only be happy when we accept ourselves as we are. We must first be aware of all the elements within us, and then we must bring them into harmony. Our physical and mental well-being are the result of understanding what is going on in ourselves. This understanding helps us respect nature &nbsp;in ourselves and also helps us bring about healing If we harm another &nbsp;human being, we harm ourselves.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To accumulate wealth and own excessive portions of the world's natural resources is to deprive our fellow humans of the chance to live. To participate in oppressive and unjust social systems is to widen the gap between rich and poor and thereby aggravate the situation of social injustice. Yet we tolerate excess, injustice, and war, while remaining unaware that the human race as a family is suffering. While some members of the human family are suffering and starving, for us to enjoy false security and wealth is a sign of insanity.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;fate of each individual is inextricably linked to the fate of the whole human race. We must let others live if we ourselves want to live. The only alternative to coexistence is co-nonexistence. A civilization in which we kill and ex ploit others for our own aggrandizement is sick. For us to have a healthy civilization, everyone must be born with an equal right to education, work, food, shelter, world citizenship, and the ability to circulate freely and settle on any part of the Earth. Political and economic systems that deny one person these rights harm the whole human family. We must begin by becoming aware of what is happening to every member of the human family if we want to repair the damage already done.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">To bring about &nbsp;peace, we must work for harmonious coexistence. If we continue to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world, imprisoning ourselves in our narrow concerns &nbsp;and immediate &nbsp;problems, we are not likely to make peace or to survive. It is difficult for one individual to preserve harmony among the elements within himself, and it is even more difficult to preserve harmony among the members of the human family. We have to understand the human race to bring it into harmony. Cruelty and disruption destroy the harmony of the family. We need legislation &nbsp;that &nbsp;keeps us from doing &nbsp;violence &nbsp;to ourselves &nbsp;or nature, and prevents us from being disruptive and cruel.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We have created a system that we cannot control. This system imposes itself on us, and we have become its slaves.<span class="calibre4">
</span>Most of us, in order to have a house, a car, a refrigerator, a Tv, and so on, must sacrifice our time and our lives in exchange. We are constantly under the pressure of time. In former times, we could afford three hours for one cup of tea, enjoying the company of our friends in a serene and spiritual &nbsp;atmosphere. We could organize a party to celebrate the blossoming of one orchid in our garden. But to day we can no longer afford these things. We say that time is money. We have created a society in which the rich be come richer and the poor become poorer, and in which we are so caught up in our own immediate problems that we cannot afford to be aware of what is going on with the rest of the human family. We see images on Tv, but we do not really understand our Third World brothers and sisters.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The individual and all of humanity are both part of nature and should be able to live in harmony with nature. Nature can be cruel and disruptive and therefore, at times, needs to be controlled. To control is not to dominate or oppress &nbsp;but to harmonize &nbsp;and equilibrate. We must be deep friends with nature in order to control certain aspects of it. This &nbsp;requires &nbsp;a full understanding of nature. Typhoons, tornadoes, droughts, floods, volcanic eruptions, and proliferations of harmful insects all constitute danger and destruction to life. Although &nbsp;parts of nature, &nbsp;these things disrupt the harmony of nature. We should be able to prevent to a large degree the destruction that natural disasters cause, but we must do it in a way that preserves life and encourages harmony.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;excessive use of pesticides that kill all kinds of insects and upset the ecological balance is an example of our lack of wisdom in trying &nbsp;to control &nbsp;nature. Economic<span class="calibre4">
</span>growth that devastates nature by polluting and exhausting nonrenewable &nbsp;resources, rendering &nbsp;the Earth impossible for beings to live on, is another. Such economic growth may appear to benefit some humans, but in reality it disrupts and destroys the whole of nature to which we all belong.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The harmony and equilibrium in the individual, society, and nature are being destroyed. Individuals are sick, society is sick, and nature is sick. We must reestablish harmony and equilibrium, but how? Where can we begin the work of healing? Would we begin with the individual, society, or the environment? We must work in all three &nbsp;domains. People of different disciplines tend to stress their particular areas. For example, politicians consider an effective rearrangement of society necessary for the salvation of humans and nature, and therefore urge that everyone engage in the struggle to change political systems.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We Buddhist monks are like psychotherapists in that we tend to look at the problem from the viewpoint of mental health. Meditation &nbsp;aims at creating harmony and equilibrium in the life of the individual. Buddhist meditation uses the breath as a tool to calm and harmonize the whole human being. As in any therapeutic practice, the patient is placed in an environment that favors the restoration &nbsp;of harmony. Usually psychotherapists &nbsp;spend their time observing and then advising their patients. I know of some, however, who, like monks, observe themselves first, recognizing the need to free their own selves from the fears, anxieties, and despair that exist in each of us. Many therapists seem to think that they themselves have no mental problems, but the monk recognizes in himself the susceptibility to fears and anxieties, and to the mental illness that is caused by the inhuman social and economic systems that prevail in today's world.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Buddhists believe that the reality of the individual, society, and nature's integral being will reveal itself to us as we recover, gradually ceasing to be possessed by anxiety, fear, and the dispersion of mind. Among the three-individual, society, and nature-it is the individual who begins to effect change. But in order to effect change, he or she must have personally recovered, must be whole. Since this requires an environment favorable to healing, he or she must seek the kind of life-style that is free from destructiveness. Efforts to change the environment and to change the individual are both necessary, but it is difficult to change the environment if individuals are not in a state of equilibrium. From the mental health point of view, efforts for us to recover our humanness should be given priority.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Restoring mental health does not mean simply helping individuals adjust to the modern world of rapid economic growth. The world is sick, and adapting to an unwell environment will not bring real health. Many people who seek the help of a psychotherapist are really victims of modem life, which separates human beings from the rest of nature. One way to help such a person may be to move him or her to a rural area where he can cultivate the land, grow his own food, wash his clothes in a clear river, and live simply, sharing &nbsp;the same life as millions of peasants around &nbsp;the world. For psychotherapy to be effective, we need environmental change, and psychotherapists must participate &nbsp;in efforts to change the environment. But that is only half their task. The &nbsp;other half is to help individuals be themselves, not by helping them adapt to an ill environment, but by providing them with the strength &nbsp;to change it. To tranquilize them is not the way. The explosion of bombs, the burning of napalm, the violent deaths of relatives and neighbors, the pressures &nbsp;of time, noise, and pollution, the lonely crowds have all been created by the disruptive course of our economic &nbsp;growth. They &nbsp;are all sources of mental illness, and they must end. Anything we can do to bring them to an end is preventive medicine. Political activities are not the only means to this end.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">While helping their particular patients, psychotherapists must, at the same time, recognize &nbsp;their responsibility &nbsp;to the whole human family. Their work must also prevent others &nbsp;from becoming &nbsp;ill. They &nbsp;are challenged &nbsp;to safe guard their own humanness. Like others, psychotherapists and monks need to observe first themselves and their own ways of life. If they do, I believe they will seek ways to disengage &nbsp;themselves &nbsp;from &nbsp;the present &nbsp;economic &nbsp;systems in order &nbsp;to help reestablish &nbsp;harmony and balance in life. Monks and psychotherapists are human beings. We cannot escape mental illness if we do not apply our disciplines to ourselves. Caught in forgetfulness and acquiescence to the status quo, we will gradually become victims of fear, anxiety, and egotism of all kinds. But if psychotherapists &nbsp;and monks, through mutual sharing, help each other apply our disciplines &nbsp;to our own lives, we will rediscover &nbsp;the harmony in ourselves and thereby help the whole human family.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">A tree reveals itself to an artist when he or she can establish a genuine relationship with it.

"When we are wholly ourselves, we can see how one person by living fully demonstrates to all of us that life is possible, that a future is possible. But the question, "Is a future possible?" is meaningless without seeing the millions &nbsp;of our fellow humans &nbsp;who suffer, live, and die around us.

There &nbsp;was a beautiful hillside, lush with trees and flowers, and on it was a little house. But each time I approached the hillside, obstacles prevented me from climbing it, and then I woke up.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;dream recurred many times. I continued to do my work and to practice mindfulness, &nbsp;trying to be in touch with the beautiful trees, people, flowers, and sunshine that surrounded me in Europe &nbsp;and North America. I looked deeply at these things, and I played under the trees with the children exactly as I had in Vietnam. Mter a year, the dream &nbsp;stopped. Seeds of acceptance and &nbsp;joy had been planted in me, and I began to look at Europe, America, and other countries in Asia as also my home. I realized that my home is the Earth. Whenever I felt homesick for Vietnam, I went outside into a backyard or a park, and found a place to practice &nbsp;breathing, walking, and smiling &nbsp;among &nbsp;the trees.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">But some cities had very few trees, even then. I can imagine someday soon a city with no trees in it at all. Imagine a city that has only one tree left. People there are mentally disturbed, because they are so alienated from nature. Then one doctor in the city sees why people are getting sick, and he offers each person who comes to him this prescription: "You are sick because you are cut off from Mother Nature. Every morning, take a bus, go to the tree in the center of the city, and hug it for fifteen minutes. Look at the beautiful green tree and smell its fragrant bark."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">After three months &nbsp;of practicing &nbsp;this, the patient will feel much better. But because many people suffer from the same malady and the doctor &nbsp;always gives the same prescription, after a short time, the line of people waiting their tum to embrace the tree gets to be very long, more than a mile, and people begin to get impatient. Fifteen minutes is now too long for each person to hug the tree, so the city council legislates a five-minute maximum. Then &nbsp;they have to shorten it to one minute, and then only a few seconds. Finally, there is no remedy at all for the sickness.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If we are not mindful, &nbsp;we might &nbsp;be in that situation soon. We have to remember that our body is not limited to what lies within &nbsp;the boundary of our skin. Our &nbsp;body is much more immense. &nbsp;We know that &nbsp;if our &nbsp;heart &nbsp;stops beating, the flow of our life will stop, but we do not take the time to notice the many things outside of our bodies that are equally essential for our survival. If the ozone layer around our Earth were to disappear for even an instant, we would die. If the sun were to stop shining, the flow of our life would stop. The sun is our second heart, our heart outside of our body. It gives all life on Earth the warmth necessary for existence. Plants live thanks to the sun. Their leaves absorb the sun's energy, along with carbon dioxide from the air, to produce food for the tree, the flower, the plankton. And thanks to plants, we and other animals can live. All of us-people, animals, &nbsp;plants, and minerals-"consume" the sun, directly and indirectly. We cannot begin to describe all the effects of the sun, that great heart outside of our body.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">When we look at green vegetables, we should know that it is the sun that is green and not just the vegetables. The green color in the leaves of the vegetables is due to the presence &nbsp;of the sun. Without the sun,&nbsp; no living being could &nbsp;survive. Without sun, water, air, and soil, &nbsp;there would be no vegetables. The vegetables are the coming-to gether of many conditions near and far.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">There is no phenomenon in the universe that does not intimately concern us, from a pebble resting at the bottom of the ocean, to the movement of a galaxy millions of light years away. Walt Whitman said, "I believe a blade of grass is no less than &nbsp;the &nbsp;journey-work of the stars..." These words are not philosophy. They come from the depths of his soul. He also said, "I am large, I contain multitudes."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">This &nbsp;might be called a meditation on "interbeing endlessly interwoven." All phenomena are interdependent. When we think of a speck of dust, a flower, or a human being, our thinking cannot break loose from the idea of unity, of one, of calculation. We see a line drawn between one and many, one and not one. But if we truly realize the interdependent nature of the dust, the flower, and the human being, we see that unity cannot &nbsp;exist without &nbsp;diversity. Unity and diversity interpenetrate each other freely. Unity is diversity, and diversity is unity. This is the principle of interbeing.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If you are a mountain climber or someone who enjoys</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">the countryside or the forest, you know that forests are our lungs outside of our bodies. Yet we have been acting in a way that has allowed millions of square miles of land to be deforested, and we have also destroyed the air, the rivers, and parts of the ozone layer. We are imprisoned in our small selves, thinking only of some comfortable conditions for this small self, while we destroy our large self. If we want to change the situation, we must begin by being our true selves. To be our true selves means we have to <span class="italic">be </span>the forest, the river, and the ozone layer. If we visualize our selves as the forest, we will experience the hopes and fears of the trees. If we don't do this, the forests will die, and we will lose our chance for peace. When we understand &nbsp;that we inter-are with the trees, we will know that it is up to us to make an effort to keep the trees alive. In the last twenty years, our automobiles and factories have created acid rain that has destroyed so many trees. Because we inter-are with the trees, we know that if they do not live, we too will disappear very soon.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">We humans think we are smart,&nbsp; but an orchid, for ex ample, knows how to produce noble, symmetrical flowers, and a snail knows how to make a beautiful, well-proportioned shell. Compared with their knowledge, ours is not worth much at all. We should bow deeply before the orchid and the snail and join our palms reverently before the monarch &nbsp;butterfly and the magnolia tree. The &nbsp;feeling of respect for all species will help us recognize the noblest nature in ourselves.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">An oak tree is an oak tree. That &nbsp;is all an oak tree needs to do. If an oak tree is less than an oak tree, we will all be in trouble. In our former &nbsp;lives, we were rocks, clouds, and trees. We have also been an oak tree. This is not just Buddhist; it is scientific. We humans are a young species. We were plants, we were trees, and now we have become humans. We have to remember &nbsp;our past existences and be humble. We can learn a lot from an oak tree.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">All life is impermanent. We are all children of the Earth, and, at some time, she will take us back to herself again. We are continually arising from Mother Earth, being nurtured &nbsp;by her, and then returning to her. Like us, plants are born, live for a period of time, and then return to the Earth. When &nbsp;they decompose, they fertilize our gardens. Living vegetables and decomposing vegetables are part of the same reality. Without one, the other cannot be. After six months, compost becomes fresh vegetables again. Plants &nbsp;and the Earth &nbsp;rely on each other. &nbsp;Whether the Earth &nbsp;is fresh, beautiful, and green, or arid and parched depends on the plants.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">It also depends on us. Our way of walking on the Earth has a great influence on animals and plants. We have killed so many animals and plants and destroyed their environments. Many are now extinct. In turn, our environment is now harming us. We are like sleepwalkers, not knowing what we are doing or where we are heading. Whether we can wake up or not depends on whether we can walk mindfully on our Mother Earth. The future of all life, including our own, depends on our mindful steps.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Birds' songs express joy, beauty, and purity, and evoke in us vitality and love. So many beings in the universe love us unconditionally. The trees, the water, and the air don't ask anything of us; they just love us. Even though we need this kind of love, we continue to destroy them. By destroying the animals, the air, and the trees, we are destroying ourselves. We must learn to practice unconditional love for all beings so that the animals, the air, the trees, and the minerals can continue to be themselves.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Our ecology should be a deep ecology-not only deep, but universal. There is pollution &nbsp;in our consciousness. Television, films, and newspapers are forms of pollution for us and our children. They sow seeds of violence and anxiety in us and pollute our consciousness, just as we destroy our environment by farming with chemicals, clear-cutting the trees, and polluting the water. We need to protect the ecology of the Earth and the ecology of the mind, or this kind of violence and recklessness will spill over into even more areas of life.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Our Earth, our green beautiful Earth is in danger, and all of us know it. Yet we act as if our daily lives have nothing to do with the situation of the world. If the Earth were your body, you would be able to feel many areas where she is suffering. Many people are aware of the world's suffering, and their hearts are filled with compassion. They know what needs to be done, and they engage in political, social, and environmental work to try to change things. But after a period of intense involvement, they become discouraged, because they lack the strength needed to sustain a life of action. Real strength &nbsp;is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">If we change our daily lives-the way we think, speak, and act-we change the world. The &nbsp;best way to take care of the environment is to take care of the environmentalist. Many Buddhist teachings help us understand our inter connectedness with our Mother, &nbsp;the Earth. &nbsp;One of the deepest is the <span class="italic">Diamond Sutra, </span>which is written in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and his senior disciple, Subhuti. It begins &nbsp;with &nbsp;this &nbsp;question &nbsp;by Subhuti: "If daughters and sons of good families wish to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind, what should they rely on and what should they do to master their thinking?" This is the same as asking, "If I want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and principles should I use?"</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;Buddha answers, "We have to do our best to help every living being cross the ocean of suffering. But after all beings have arrived at the shore of liberation, no being at all has been carried to the other shore. If you are still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a life span, you are not an authentic bodhisattva." Self, person, living being, and life span are four notions that pre vent us from seeing reality.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Life is one. We do not need to slice it into pieces and call this or that piece a "self." What we call a self is made only of non-self elements. When &nbsp;we look at a flower, for example, we may think that it is different from "non-flower" things. But when we look more deeply, we see that everything in the cosmos is in that flower. Without &nbsp;all of the non-flower elements-sunshine, clouds, earth, minerals, heat, rivers, and consciousness-a flower cannot be. That is why the Buddha teaches that the self does not exist. We have to discard all distinctions between self and non-self. How can anyone work to protect the environment without this insight?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The second notion that prevents us from seeing reality is the notion of a person, a human being. We usually discriminate between humans and non-humans, thinking that we are more important than other species. But since we humans are made of non-human elements, to protect our selves we have to protect all of the non-human &nbsp;elements. There is no other way. If you think, "God created man in His own image and He created other &nbsp;things for man to use," you are already making the discrimination that man is more &nbsp;important than&nbsp; other &nbsp;things. &nbsp;When &nbsp;we see that humans have no self, we see that to take care of the environment (the non-human elements) is to take care of humanity. The best way to take good care of men and women so that they can be truly healthy and happy is to take care of the environment.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I know ecologists who are not happy in their families. They work hard to improve the environment, partly to escape family life. If someone is not happy within himself, how can he help the environment? That is why the Buddha teaches that to protect the non-human elements is to protect humans, and to protect humans is to protect non-human elements.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The third notion we have to break through is the notion of a living being. We think that we living beings are different from inanimate objects, but according to the principle of interbeing, living beings are comprised of non-living being elements. When &nbsp;we look into &nbsp;ourselves, &nbsp;we see minerals and all &nbsp;other non-living-being elements. Why discriminate against what we call inanimate? To protect living beings, we must protect the stones, the soil, and the oceans. Before the atomic bomb was dropped &nbsp;on Hiroshima, there &nbsp;were many beautiful stone &nbsp;benches in the parks. As the Japanese were rebuilding their city, they dis covered that these stones were dead, so they carried them away and buried them. Then &nbsp;they brought in live stones. Do not think these things are not alive. Atoms are always moving. Electrons move at nearly the speed of light. Ac cording to the teaching of Buddhism, &nbsp;these atoms and stones are consciousness itself. That is why discrimination by living beings against non-living beings should be dis carded.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;last notion is that of a life span. We think that we have been alive since a certain point in time and that prior to that moment, our life did not exist. This distinction between life and non-life is not correct. Life is made of death, and death &nbsp;is made of life. We have to accept &nbsp;death; &nbsp;it makes life possible. The cells in our body are dying every day, but we never think to organize funerals for them. The death of one cell allows for the birth of another. Life and death are two aspects of the same reality. We must learn to die peacefully so that others may live. This deep meditation brings forth non-fear, non-anger, and non-despair, the strengths we need for our work. With non-fear, even when we see that a problem is huge, we will not burn out. We will know how to make small, steady steps. If those who work to protect the environment &nbsp;contemplate &nbsp;these four notions, they will know how to be and how to act.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In another Buddhist text, the <span class="italic">Avatamsaka (''Adorning the</span>
<span class="italic">Buddha with Flowers'? Sutra, </span>the Buddha further elaborates his insights concerning our "interpenetration" with our environment. Please meditate with me on the "Ten Penetrations":</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The first is, "All worlds penetrate a single pore. A single pore penetrates all worlds." Look deeply at a flower. It may be tiny, but the sun, the clouds, and everything else in the cosmos penetrates it. Nuclear physicists say very much the same thing: one electron is made by all electrons; one electron is in all electrons.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The second penetration &nbsp;is, "All living beings penetrate one body. One body penetrates &nbsp;all living beings." When you kill a living being, you kill yourself and everyone else as well.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The third is, "Infinite time penetrates one second. One second penetrates infinite time." A <span class="italic">ksana </span>is the shortest period of time, actually much shorter than a second.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The fourth penetration is, "All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching. &nbsp;One teaching penetrates all Buddhist teachings." As a young monk, I had the opportunity to learn that Buddhism is made of non-Buddhist elements. So, whenever I study Christianity or Judaism, I find the Buddhist elements in them, and vice versa. I always respect non-Buddhist teachings. All Buddhist teachings penetrate one teaching, &nbsp;and one teaching &nbsp;penetrates all Buddhist teachings. We are free.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The fifth penetration is, "Innumerable spheres enter one sphere. One sphere enters innumerable spheres." A sphere is a geographical &nbsp;space. Innumerable spheres &nbsp;penetrate into one particular area, and one particular area enters into innumerable spheres. It means that when you destroy one area, you destroy every area. When you save one area, you save all areas. A student asked me, "Thay, &nbsp;there &nbsp;are so many urgent problems, what should I do?" I said, "Take one thing and do it very deeply and carefully, and you will be doing everything at the same time."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The sixth penetration is, "All sense organs penetrate one organ. One organ penetrates all sense organs"-eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. To take care of one means<span class="calibre4">
</span>to take care of many. To take care of your eyes means to take care of the eyes of innumerable living beings.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The seventh penetration is, "All sense organs penetrate non-sense &nbsp;organs. Non-sense &nbsp;organs penetrate &nbsp;all sense organs." &nbsp;Not only do non-sense organs penetrate &nbsp;sense organs, they also penetrate non-sense organs. There &nbsp;is no discrimination. Sense organs are made of non-sense-organ elements. That is why they penetrate &nbsp;non-sense &nbsp;organs. This helps us remember the &nbsp;teaching of the &nbsp;<span class="italic">Diamond Sutra.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The eighth penetration &nbsp;is, "One perception &nbsp;penetrates all perceptions. All perceptions penetrate one perception." If your perception is not accurate, it will influence all other perceptions &nbsp;in yourself and others. Suppose a bus driver has an incorrect &nbsp;perception. We know what may happen. One perception penetrates all perceptions.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;ninth penetration &nbsp;is, "Every sound penetrates one sound. One sound penetrates every sound." This is a very deep teaching. If we understand &nbsp;one sound or one word, we can understand all.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;tenth penetration is, "All times penetrate one time. One time penetrates all times-past, present, and future. In one second, you can find the past, present, and future." In the past, you can see the present and the future. In the present, you can find the past and future. In the future, you can find the past and present. They "inter-contain" each other. &nbsp;Space contains &nbsp;time, time contains &nbsp;space. In the teaching of interpenetration, one determines the other, the other determines this one. When we realize our nature of interbeing, we will stop blaming and killing, because we know that we inter-are. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Interpenetration is an important teaching, &nbsp;but it still suggests that things outside of one another penetrate into each other. Interbeing is a step forward. We are already inside, so we don't have to enter. In contemporary nuclear physics, people talk about implicit order and explicit order. In the explicit order, things exist outside of each otherthe table outside of the flower, the sunshine outside of the cypress tree. In the implicit &nbsp;order, we see that&nbsp; they are inside each other-the sunshine &nbsp;inside the cypress tree. Interbeing is the implicit order. To practice mindfulness and to look deeply into the nature of things is to discover the true nature of interbeing. There we find peace and develop the strength to be in touch with everything. With this understanding, we can easily sustain the work of loving and caring for the Earth and for each other for a long time.</blockquote><p class="calibre1">&nbsp;</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_link-49"></div>

Recognizing &nbsp;this, I propose reductions in military spending with corresponding allocations to be used for the alleviation of world hunger. As the strongest nation on Earth, the United States can take the first step with an independent initiative for stopping &nbsp;the arms race, and this action can be taken regardless of the actions that are taken or not taken by any other country.

Forty thousand children a day and ten million people a year die of starvation. This suffering cannot be alleviated by government action alone. As individuals, we must also assume responsibility and lend our efforts and our hearts to the work of ending human suffering and building human solidarity. For example, if people in Western countries&nbsp; reduced their consumption &nbsp;of meat and alcohol by just fifty percent, &nbsp;the resultant &nbsp;availabili<span class="calibre4">ty </span>of grain would change the fate of millions of starving people in the developing countries. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">During the war in Vietnam &nbsp;we proposed &nbsp;a cease-fire plan to the Americans.

The same can be done regarding the manufacture of arms.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">I hope the United &nbsp;States will independently declare a stop to the arms race, and invite Russia, China, &nbsp;and all other arms-producing countries to do the same.

Then, if other &nbsp;countries do reciprocate, the U.S. could take another &nbsp;step toward complete and general disarmament.

As Vietnamese Buddhists we call for a return to the source in order to rediscover a feeling of confidence in the value of our traditional culture, to foster that value, and to enrich it. An individual is not a separate, independent entity, but a continuation of the ancestral line, tradition, and culture. This fact is a reflection of the awareness of the teachings of interdependent origination and selflessness in Buddhism.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Anyone whosoever living anywhere on this planet Earth, if they are aware of the state of separation and alienation of people of our time, will look at the world and act in accord with this principle.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre3">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2"><span class="italic">3.Vietnamese &nbsp;Buddhists Have No Enemies (Only Love andCompassion Can Put an End to Hatred)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Vietnamese students of the Buddha wish to live in peace in their own hearts and at peace with all other sectors of the Vietnamese people, without discriminating according to race, creed, and ideology, as long as they all share the willingness to protect the nature and the cultural heritage of our land.

No one knew how many thousands of years it had lived. Its trunk was so large that the arm spans of eighteen &nbsp;people could not embrace it; great roots pushed up through &nbsp;the ground &nbsp;and spread to a radius of fifty meters. The &nbsp;earth beneath the tree's shadow was unusually cool. Its bark was as hard as rock; if you pressed a fingernail against it, pain ran through &nbsp;your finger. Its branches &nbsp;held tens of thou sands of nests, sheltering &nbsp;hundreds of thousands of birds, both large and small.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In the morning, when the sun rose, the first rays of light were like a conductor's baton, initiating a mighty symphony, the voices of thousands of birds, a symphony &nbsp;as majestic &nbsp;as the sun dawning &nbsp;behind &nbsp;the summit &nbsp;of the mountain. All the creatures of the mountain and forest arose, either on two feet or four, slowly, in wonder.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">In the great tree there was one hole large as a grapefruit from Bien Hoa and twelve meters from the ground. In the hole lay a small brown egg. No one could say if a bird had brought &nbsp;the beautiful egg to the hole. Some thought &nbsp;the egg had not come from a living bird but had been forged by the sacred air of the forest and the life energy of the great tree.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Thirty years passed; the egg remained &nbsp;intact. Some nights, birds would be startled from their sleep by a cloud hovering over the hole and a brilliant light shining there, illuminating an entire &nbsp;corner &nbsp;of the forest. &nbsp;Finally, one night, &nbsp;under a full moon, the egg opened &nbsp;and a strange bird was born. The bird was very little; it gave a small chirp in the cold night. The moon was very bright; the stars were very bright. The &nbsp;tiny bird cried throughout the night. Its cry was neither tragic nor bold; it was a cry of surprise and strangeness. It cried until the sun appeared. The first rays of light opened the symphony; thousands of birds' voices broke forth. From that moment, the little bird cried no more.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">It &nbsp;grew &nbsp;quickly. The &nbsp;nuts &nbsp;and &nbsp;grains &nbsp;mother birds brought to the hole were always plenty. Soon the hole in the tree became too small, and the bird had to find another place, much larger, in which to live. It now knew how to fly; it looked for its own food and gathered sticks of straw to cover the floor of its new nest. Strangely, although the egg had been brown, the bird was as white as snow. When it flew, its wingspan was vast, and it moved slowly and very quietly. Often it flew to faraway places where white waterfalls tumbled &nbsp;day and night like the majestic &nbsp;breath &nbsp;of earth and sky.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Sometimes the &nbsp;bird did not &nbsp;return &nbsp;for several &nbsp;days. When &nbsp;it returned, it lay in its nest all day and night, thoughtfully and quietly. Its two eyes were very bright; they never lost the look of surprise they had from the beginning. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Now, in the ancient forest of Dai Lao, a hermit's small hut stood on the slope of a hill. There a monk had lived for almost <span class="calibre3">fifty </span>years. The bird often flew across Dai Lao forest; from time to time it saw the monk walking slowly down the path to the spring, &nbsp;holding a water &nbsp;jug in his hand. One day, smoke gently lingered over the roof of the humble hut and an atmosphere of warmth surrounded the hill. The bird saw two monks together on the path leading from the spring to the hut, speaking as they walked. That night the bird remained in Dai Lao forest. Concealed in the branches of a tree, the bird watched the light of the fire flickering inside the hut, where the two monks conversed through the night.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;bird flew high, high over the ancient &nbsp;forest. For several days it flew back and forth in the sky without landing. Below stood the great tree in the ancient forest; below, the creatures of the mountain and forest were concealed by grass, bushes, and trees. Since the day the bird listened to the exchange between the two monks, its bewilderment grew. Where have I come from and where will I go? How many thousands of years will the great tree stand?</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;bird had heard the two monks speak about Time.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">What is Time? Why has Time brought us here, and why will it take us away? The &nbsp;nut that a bird eats has its own delicious nature. How can I find out the nature of Time? The &nbsp;bird wanted to pick up a small piece of Time and lie quietly with it in its nest for several days to examine its nature. Even if it took months or years to examine, the bird was willing.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;bird flew high, high over the ancient forest. It was like a round balloon drifting in nothingness. The bird felt<span class="calibre4">
</span>its nature was as empty as a balloon's. The emptiness of its nature was the ground of its existence, but it was also the cause of the bird's suffering. "Time, if I could find you, certainly I could find myself," thought the bird.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">After several days and nights, the bird came to rest quietly in its nest. It had brought &nbsp;back a tiny piece of earth from the Dai Lao forest. Deep in thought, it picked up the piece of earth to examine it. The &nbsp;monk from the Dai Lao forest had said to his friend, "Time is stilled in Eternity. There Love and Beloved are One. Each blade of grass, each piece of earth, each leaf, is one with that love."</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The bird was still unable to find Time. The small token of earth from the Dai Lao forest revealed nothing. Perhaps the monk had lied to his friend. Time &nbsp;lies in Love, but where is Love? The bird remembered the splashing water falls &nbsp;endlessly &nbsp;tumbling in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Northwest Forest. It remembered the days it listened to the sound of the waterfalls from morning to evening. The &nbsp;bird had imagined itself tumbling like a waterfall. &nbsp;It &nbsp;played with the &nbsp;light shining &nbsp;on the water, with the waterfall it caressed the pebbles and rocks in the streams. In those moments, the bird felt that it was a waterfall itself, that the sound of endless falling water came from it.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">One noon, flying across the Dai Lao Forest, the bird did</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">not see the hut. The whole forest had burned; only a pile of ashes remained &nbsp;where the monk's hut had been. In a panic, the bird flew around searching. The &nbsp;monk was no longer in the forest. "Where had he gone? Corpses of animals. Corpses of birds. Had the fire consumed the monk? The &nbsp;bird was bewildered. Time, &nbsp;what are you? Why do you bring us here and why will you take us away? The monk said, "Time is stilled in Eternity." If that is so, perhaps Love has returned the monk to Itself.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Suddenly the bird felt anxious. It flew swiftly back to the ancient forest. Anguished cries of many birds. Explosions. The &nbsp;ancient &nbsp;forest, far away, was burning. &nbsp;Faster, faster still, the bird flew. The fire licked the sky. The fire spread near &nbsp;the &nbsp;great &nbsp;tree. &nbsp;Hundreds of&nbsp; thousands of &nbsp;birds shrieked in fright.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The fire approached the great tree. The bird fanned the fire with its wings, hoping to put it out, but the fire burned more fiercely. The bird sped to the spring, dipped its wings in the water, and rushed back to shake the water over the forest. The drops sizzled. It was not enough, not enough. The &nbsp;bird's entire body soaked in water was not enough to extinguish the fire.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Cries of hundreds of thousands of birds. Screams &nbsp;of young birds without feathers to fly. The fire began to burn the great tree. Why was there &nbsp;no rain? Why didn't &nbsp;the downpour that fell endlessly in the Northwest Forest flow like a waterfall? The bird let forth a piercing cry. The cry was tragic and passionate and was suddenly transformed into the rushing sound of a waterfall. All at once, the bird felt the fullness of its existence. Loneliness and emptiness vanished as an illusion. The image of the monk. The image of the sun behind the mountain peak. The image of rushing water falling endlessly through a thousand lifetimes. The cry of the bird was now the full sound of the waterfall. Without anxiety, the bird plunged into the forest fire like a majestic waterfall.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;next morning was calm. The&nbsp; marvelous rays of the sun shone, but there was no symphony, no voices of tens of thousands of birds. Portions of the forest were completely burned. The great tree still stood, but more than half of its branches and leaves were charred. Corpses of large birds, corpses of small birds. The morning forest was silent.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">The &nbsp;birds still alive called one another, their voices be wildered. They did not know by what grace the clear sky had suddenly poured forth &nbsp;rain, extinguishing &nbsp;the forest fire the afternoon before. They &nbsp;remembered &nbsp;seeing the bird shaking water from its two wings. They knew it was the white bird from the great tree. They flew everywhere throughout the forest seeking the corpse of the white bird, but they did not find it.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_2">Perhaps &nbsp;the bird had flown away to live in a different forest. Perhaps &nbsp;the bird had been killed by the fire. The great &nbsp;tree, its body covered &nbsp;with wounds, did not say a word. The birds cocked their heads to the sky and began to build new nests in the wounded &nbsp;body of the great &nbsp;tree. Does the great tree miss the child to which sacred mountain air and the life energy &nbsp;of four &nbsp;thousand &nbsp;years had given birth? &nbsp;Bird, where &nbsp;have you gone? Listen &nbsp;to the monk: I believe Time &nbsp;has returned &nbsp;the bird to the Love that is the source of all things.<span class="calibre4">
